Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, a real edge of your seat type of deal. For one the natural disasters in the film can happen anytime, for example, the yellow stone caldera is a real super volcano that scientists and geologist have been studying. They do say it will erupt again in the future, but they don't know when? as for the earthquakes those are real, the shifting of continents? I guess a major event like that can happen? It did millions of years ago.\\n\\nI for one liked the action in it, I also liked the fact that there was humor in it to break the ice of all the seriousness and drama. All the cast does a wonderful job, Danny Glover was excellent playing the President of the United States. John Cusack was good, but I feel they should have put a more action packed actor in it as the dad who saves his family, Cusack does not have action in him, but then again like I said he did a good job in the movie.\\n\\nMy favorite character was the crazy guy that was obsessed with the Yellow stone caldera, he made me laugh so much. But then again he was completely crazy and lost his life because of it. I feel like Gordon played by Tom McCarthy should have had a better ending to his life, like to save someone. The movie also makes me think about this, in times of disaster and dire need, how will we act towards other human beings? If we were on three boats, trying to survive, would we open the gates and let others in? Or leave them? Makes you think about your compassion and humanity.\\n\\n2012 is a thinking movie, it will not only make you jump out of your seat but it will get your mind moving about things.

They discover that the powerful leaders and the money men supporters have gotten together to build arks to save themselves from an oncoming flood. OK, fine premise so far, but there is so much silliness in the way that the plot is drawn, and especially with a powerful Russian businessman, his two Pugsly Addams like twin sons, his much younger mistress, and his personal pilot who\\'s obviously having an affair with the mistress.\\n\\nMcCarthy, after only a few flying lessons, is assigned as co-pilot, and already haven flown over Los Angeles where the ground is crumbling beneath them, he must now assist the head Russian pilot in flying this plane that is the size of three Concords. \"It\\'s huge!\", McCarthy exclaims, to which the Boris Badinoff sounding Russian tycoon simply responds, \"It\\'s Russian.\" If you can get through Woody Harrelson\\'s embarrassing performance as a stoner who first alerts Cusack to the pending doom, then try not rolling your eyes at the sight of Cusack\\'s car barreling down a Santa Monica, California street where the road literally is exploding directly behind them. Then, there\\'s the shots them driving or flying through collapsing highways (Goodbye, 10 freeway!) and various large glass buildings, and while exciting to see, it just gets to be a bit too much.

So there is an explosion at the surface of the sun bigger than what has ever been witnessed before. That has the effect of making the core of the earth, or at least a greater proportion of the inner mass go up in temperature at a great speed, making this mass more fluid, hence liberating the tectonic plates and the continents.\\n\\nThat means earthquakes, tsunamis and so on. Our news are full of such events. Just make them bigger, more gigantic. Waves that are nearly 2,000 meters high and you have it.\\n\\nAdd to that Tibet and the Chinese. Noah can be repeated again: a remake of the arch and there we are. There will be three arks at the end, after the catastrophe, because we need a trinity somewhere. Without the Chinese nothing could have been done, and what's more they provided the work force, probably cheap, and the security forces to build the arks first and then to make sure only the people who have the proper passes can go on them. The world without the Chinese could not go through the apocalypse without any comfort.\\n\\nThe US president is black of course because in 2009 it was obvious he was.\\n\\nA little bit of Buddhism does not harm but at the same time the only surviving Buddhist monk actually cheated the system with his brother, a lay person, to save their own parents, and end up saving a few more as stowaways.\\n\\nAdd to that a family situation and you have it all: parents divorced, the ex-wife has a new boy friend. The children of the broken marriage, a boy and a girl, are the perfect American reconstructed or recomposed family.\\n\\nThe catastrophe itself is nothing but special effects. They are funny, maybe impressive but certainly not frightening. So banal after all. We can imagine catastrophes of this type every day and some happen every other week.\\n\\nThe funny part is the end. The arks find out that only Africa has survived, with a pun on the Cape of Good Hope. Humanity started in Africa and it will start again in Africa. Marvelous. But rather simple minded.\\n\\nNow and then some ethical questions are brought up, but they are so easy and the answer is so banal. In such a catastrophe those ethical questions would certainly not be the main questions. The main question would be to keep people from panicking or just plain hurting if not killing one another. It is nice to think that in such an extreme situation people would think of saving their neighbors. We can always dream.\\n\\nDr Jacques COULARDEAU \", '6']\n",

The John Cusack character should have died 83 times in this movie. All I kept thinking about was how well it would lend itself to one of those \"Everything Wrong With 2012\" video commentaries. The last time I remember a movie being this implausible was Speed, and it left a bad aftertaste that\\'s never faded. But that was at least an enjoyable flick.\\n\\nFaster than a speeding bullet, more invincible than Evel Knievel, John Cusack\\'s character has a knack for jumping chasms and being at the right place at the right time. Through luck, magic, miracles, superpowers, whatever, he makes one incredible split-second escape after another. This device is tremendously abused, not just in how close the calls are, but the sheer number of them.\\n\\nAt every turn, something goes hopelessly wrong (beyond just the natural disasters). But even that doesn\\'t stop the charmed Cusack from coming out of it alive (by the skin of his teeth). And with people dying all around him, every single one of his family makes it. Every falling fireball misses them...every time they pull away in a vehicle or plane, a gorge opens up exactly where they need to go so they have to jump it. Over and over and over and over. There is no relief from the ridiculousness.\\n\\nThe pinnacle of ridiculousness is this scene: As soon as John Cusack finds the map that will save his family, a huge chasm opens up in the ground, and John naturally falls right into it. BUT never fear he manages to grab onto the edge in the nick of time and pulls himself up...still holding the map in his hand!!! Is this Emmerich guy an adult?? I understand he wants to take us on a nonstop roller coaster ride, but... If they would simply have made the earth open up a few meters away, instead of a millimeter, or they could make their getaway by a few seconds, instead of a quarter second EVERY TIME, it would still have been suspenseful, but plausible enough to not make you want to scream at the screen.\\n\\nTheir plane (since the charmed Cusack is on it) glides effortlessly between falling buildings. It\\'s the end of the world and they\\'re seriously low on fuel -- why do they never dump the weight of all those excess autos? But...they continue on their hopeless journey. In the end, they only made it because...their destination had shifted! What luck.\\n\\nI saw the ship plowing into the White House in the trailer and thought I was in the mood for a big disaster flick, so I picked up the DVD in the bargain bin.\\n\\nThe FX were grand as you would expect or could hope for, and the acting was passable. The problem was with the script. The dialogue, the characterizations and the plot -- all dreadful. I cry pretty easily, but it was very hard to feel anything for any of the characters in this movie. Except maybe Danny Glover. They tried to make jokes but they weren\\'t funny. Only Woody Harrelson\\'s character was somewhat interesting.\\n\\nThe thing about selling tickets to the arks was played up as some terrible fault in humanity, but really how else were they going to get the money to build them? The governments of the world all cooperate quite civilly in the face of this impending catastrophe that would put men at each other\\'s throats. They\\'ve gotta kill anyone who figures out their plan...yet they\\'re not worried about any of the people who bought tickets leaking the info? Like what if someone declined the offer because they didn\\'t believe the world was going to end? Oh, maybe they were killed as well? In the wake of the Japanese tsunami, one has to wonder with all the nuclear plants and toxic chemical stores how doomed they would really be no matter what..\\n\\nRight up to the end, as the every-man-for-himself mentality would have been peaking, the plot did not let up on its ludicrousness. As the arks are taking off, forget that the clock is ticking and every second counts...forget that there will not be enough food/supplies and everyone on board could die and this all will be for nothing...Chiwetel\\'s impassioned plea convinces every world ruler to let everyone on at the last second.\\n\\nAnd it ends with a lame love song...\\n\\nAnd now I will happily part with this DVD.

This was because the producers wanted a big enough character pool to kill off several main characters while still having a nucleus of important characters survive. What made this annoying is that there were so many seemingly unrelated characters that I wasn't emotionally attached to any of them at all. My cousin and I had a fun time trying to decide who was going to die and when. Because I didn't care about any of the people in the movie, when they were in tremendous danger due to all of California falling into a giant hole to the center of the earth it really was not that exciting. In fact the only time I was on the edge of my seat was when I was reaching for my nachos.\\n\\nSpeaking of the scene were California was destroyed, it just didn't make any sense. There were buildings falling and explosions and the street was totally gone and somehow the main family managed to escape in a limo. I mean it just was ridic. Everything was totally ridiculous. Everything was destroyed except for some reason China (which is where the magic boats were that would keep everyone safe from the flood.) and for some reason Africa which they found out didn't even get flooded somehow.\\n\\nThe climax was horrible. Paris Hilton's dog gets the royal treatment while tons of other people (including a lot of religious people) were shown being violently killed.

The problem with these FX is that they go over the top: same as Twister, or the conclusion of Armageddon, where debris and rocks are swirling over the heads of our heroes, or smashing into their equipment but they escape--equipment intact--without a scratch. We can only suspend our belief so much. Here, in the early going, Cusack drives a car through a decaying city, miraculously evading destruction while buses, trucks, and buildings are crushed like paper dolls.

In 2012, the action stops with resounding CLUNK while we stop to discuss Cusack's marital problems or his relationship with his kids.

Even though his films before were not that great, they did not feel like they had to be force fed to the audience like this film did.\\n\\nWhile it has amazing visuals of an earthquake breaking up Los Angeles and several thousand foot tidal waves that toss around Air Force One and the U.S.S John F. Kennedy, the disaster is also with the characters and the story.\\n\\nThe characters are laughably one dimensional and boring. The expression of the family is the same as ours when Gordon or anyone else dies. We\\'re left sitting there going, \"Okay, he\\'s dead. No big deal.\" They expect us to be sad for characters that were more of semi-antagonistic characters and to just be okay over the death of a character we have spent the whole time watching.\\n\\nThe story is nothing more than a coincidence after a coincidence. Yes, other films have coincidences in them to move the plot along like C-3PO and R2-D2 being picked by the Lars Family in \"Star Wars\", but coincidence is the whole reason for the family\\'s survival. They get a plane and Gordon is luckily a pilot. They fly to Las Vegas where they meet up with our main protagonist Jackson\\'s boss Yuri who will not bring them with until he finds out he needs a second pilot so he has to pick Gordon. They are going to crash land but the earth shifts several thousand miles so they crash right by where the arks are being built and run luckily find a family whose son is on the arc who decide to pick them up. Then, Jackson can luckily hold his breath for ten minutes to dislodge an object that got stuck in the ark\\'s door gear which was preventing the ark from turning on.\\n\\nThe acting is awful as well. Not much else to say with acting but on another note, there is no tension in the film. The escape from Los Angeles basically destroys that because we see how invincible the family is. The second they pull out of their driveway, the earthquake is right behind them and there is not one second where they almost fall into the cracks. The second they leave the road to get around a car with stereotypical slow old ladies driving, the road in front of them falls apart. They manage to dodge a bunch of falling cars and get through a collapsing building with it barely scraping the roof of their car. The closest thing to tension that there is is the plane losing the landing gear in Vegas and then them crash landing because for one second, you think the plane might survive. At least there was about forty-five seconds of tension in the film about the all out destruction of earth.\\n\\nTo add insult to injury, one of the worst lines in cinema history is uttered right at the end of the film.

I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.\\n\\nI fear that this might become dated and unwatchable in the future, which is a shame since it's definitely Emmerich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess.

I love the thrill and excitement of not knowing whether your heroes will survive and wondering what I would do if the end of the world suddenly came upon us. With Deep Impact and the Day after tomorrow firmly in my top 10 films, I had high hopes that 2012 would be just as good, if not better than these incredible films with its use of the latest advances in cinematography. However a great disaster movie it was not meant to be, as a general film straying into science fiction it was enjoyable but not thrilling.\\n\\nI think my main issue with the film was that normally there is a hero or a few heroes, who you are rooting for all the way through to survive. 2012 bills John Cusack as the hero of the hour, who realises just how important his family is to him. However although I adore Cusack normally, my heart just wasn\\'t in it and while I want him to survive, it doesn\\'t ultimately make a difference to me either way. The film also was jam-packed with action, probably too much so, nudging on the edge of believability, with cities crumbling within the first half an hour and whilst it was very dramatic, it feels that it\\'s been drawn out and it\\'s not until the last 45 minutes that you truly got into and felt your heart start to race.\\n\\nMy other issue with the film was the way in which some characters were portrayed. Adrian Helmsely was presented as a hero who argued back to his boss, who said that it wasn\\'t right what they were doing and demanded that more people should allowed to be saved. As a scientific adviser he seemed rather inept with \"temperatures are rising with incredible velocity\" just one of the many unscientific phrases tumbling from his humanitarian lips. Carl Anheuser was shown as the bad guy, the one who tried to control who would be saved. This is all very well and good, but if this were to happen then I would argue that Anheuser is actually the one in the right. Human life needs to be preserved and to do so does mean some sacrifices.\\n\\nDespite the incredibly dire nature of several aspects of the film I found myself actually rather liking it and am a tentative fan of the film. It does require a suspension of reality on the viewers part (but surely that\\'s what films are for) and it does turn into an enjoyable film with a twisting plot that whilst it doesn\\'t leave you aching for more does mean that the film seems to fly by as though you are strapped into a roller-coaster instead of sat on your sofa.

Of its four Oscar wins, Connelly and adapted screenplay (on the most part) were worthy wins, though there were better contenders in the Best Picture and Director categories, \\'Fellowship of the Ring\\' for Best Picture and David Lynch for \\'Mulholland Drive\\' for director. Again, from personal opinion, \\'A Beautiful Mind\\'s\\' Oscar nominations were worthier of wins generally, especially Russell Crowe for Best Picture, make-up and the film editing, cinematography also should have been under serious consideration.\\n\\nThere are a few things that stop \\'A Beautiful Mind\\' from being great. Pacing can be messy, feeling rushed in some spots and then dragging in others. Admittedly though there were other places where it was perfect.\\n\\nDo agree with the portrayal of schizophrenia being problematic, it is a sensitive and courageous subject to address but those with schizophrenia and mental illness in general will find problems with how it\\'s portrayed. It is a complex and often frightening illness, that the film tries to take seriously and sensitively, but it just felt too clean and like it was being careful not to offend but ended up being too careful. Other aspects are heavy-handed.\\n\\nThe espionage subplot was intriguing mostly and gave some powerful conflict, at the same time parts not quite gelling with the rest of the film and feeling a little confused.\\n\\nHowever, \\'A Beautiful Mind\\' for want of a better word looks absolutely beautiful. The cinematography with the vibrant colours and seamless fluidity was one of the best of its year, and the period detail remarkably evocative and a joy to look at. James Horner\\'s score has garnered mixed views, mostly leaning on the positive, personally though it added a lot to the emotional power of the film, swelled thrillingly and was beautifully and cleverly orchestrated, didn\\'t think it was melodramatic at all.\\n\\n\\'A Beautiful Mind\\'s\\' adapted screenplay really makes one think while also capturing a wide range of emotions, more than making up for the lack of accuracy.

Which fortunately turned this to an even more intriguing for me. Maybe that is why my first recommendation would be do not research anything beforehand in order to avoid despoiling the surprises of this movie. These types of movies expect nil information about the plot on the viewers part. That is how they will successfully bind you.\\n\\nA beautiful mind is an American biographical drama film based on the life of John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. In this movie, John Nash was suffering from a disease schizophrenia. Now the question arrives, What the hell is Schizophrenia? Imagine if you suddenly learned that the people, the places, the moments most important to you were not gone, not dead, but worse, had never been. What kind of hell would that be? This movie is the answer. It shows, How John Nash proves that psychiatrists were wrong about schizophrenia being a brain disease like Alzheimers and Parkinson's. How he refuses to hospitalize himself and courageously decides to tackle with the imaginary people inside his mind. This is the plot on which this movie is based.\\n\\nAccording to me, what makes this movie different from others is it's extraordinary attention to the details. There is nothing mentioned in the movie which could come in conflict with your common reasoning. There are no violation of nature's law, no preternatural intelligence, no ostentatious scenes which could be refuted by my reasoning skills. For example, When Parcher implanted IC inside Nash's hand which he used while unlocking the doors (by scanning his hand on the scanner). In the next scenes where movie reveals Parcher was a fictional character because of Nash's disease. I was in between devils and the deep as my mind was continuously asking why the hell he was not checking his hand for the IC? That would be the biggest proof whether the characters are imaginary or real. Guess what? Within few moments I see Nash scratching his hand for the IC. which made both of us believe that he was suffering from the disease. Again, when Parcher meets Nash and tries to maintain his credibility of his real existence. He said the IC which was implanted vanished because it was made of Radium which decayed completely. I was enthralled by this scene and for the second time along with Nash, I believed Parcher is no more a fictional character.\\n\\nI think, the rationality of this movie is what makes it so great. While watching this movie, I placed myself at Nash's situation, and was trying to figure out how I would deal. Believe me, the things which I thought I would do to solve these conflict, the same solutions Nash used in the movie. The only thing which I think only Nash could do was the finesse with which he dealt with such characters.\\n\\nFurthermore, the way this movie tries to explain things with rationality which themselves are irrational is simply beyond one's approach. Quoting one scene from the movie.\\n\\nWhen John Nash Proposes Alicia.\\n\\nNash: Alicia, does our relationship warrant long-term commitment? I need some kind of proof, some kind of verifiable, empirical data.\\n\\nAlicia: I'm sorry, just give me a moment to redefine my girlish notions of romance.\\n\\nAlicia: How big is the universe?\\n\\nNash: Infinite.\\n\\nAlicia: How do you know?\\n\\nNash: I know because all the data indicates it's infinite.\\n\\nAlicia: But it hasn't been proved yet.\\n\\nNash: No.\\n\\nAlicia: You haven't seen it.\\n\\nNash: No.\\n\\nAlicia: How do you know for sure?\\n\\nNash: I don't, I just believe it.\\n\\nAlicia: It's the same with love I guess.\\n\\nThere are still a lot more to say about this movie which I found highly admirable.

Ron Howard used to make movies that worked both on and beneath the surface, but this is a case where many elements of one man\\'s life overlap and generate more confusion than fascination. That it won the Oscar for Best Picture has the same puzzling effect than of a math riddle.\\n\\nThe film is a legitimate biopic about one of the most interesting minds of the twentieth century. I\\'m not sure I would call it \\'beautiful\\', even Einstein didn\\'t get that title, but \\'fascinating\\', it sure was. It belongs to John Forbes Nash, the mathematician and economist who paved the way for a new conception of governing dynamics and competition, less through the theory of games than the notion of equilibrium, the fact that the lesser of two evils is a wiser option than \\'everyone for himself\\'. I\\'m not being persnickety but I wish the film dedicated more time to his revolutionary work, I studied economics and the \\'Nash equilibrium\\' was one of these lessons that instantly inspired me and I could see countless situations where the genius of Nash was applied.\\n\\nMaybe being a math buff influenced my expectations and I\\'m perfectly aware that this is only a cinematic adaptation, that Ron Howard or Akiva Goldman (the writer) are entitled to their narrative choices, but I was disappointed to see the \\'sick\\' side of Nash\\' personality being shamelessly unleashed especially after the superficial treatment his game theory got, though I loved its application on the way to approach women. The second act of the film primarily deals with the diseases that struck that \\'beautiful\\' mind but could have been a more subtle treatment of his mental condition, not just a translation into archetypal cinematic language but something in par with the subtle and realistic way Nash was played in the first act as a graduate student from Princeton whose sociability isn\\'t exactly his strongest suit and his interactions with his co-workers or with women work as efficient comical moments.\\n\\nIndeed, to a fellow recipient of a prestigious Mathematics scholarship (Josh Lucas), Nash slyly declares that he found nothing seminal in any of the articles he wrote, and to a woman, well, let\\'s just that a reference to sexual fluids earned him a nice slap in the face. Russell Crowe is quite convincing as Nash, a guy never looking his straight in the eyes, often down, looking for patterns in everything, and looking forward to having his scientific epiphany. There\\'s a moment where he just lost a Go game and is puzzled because he played the part perfectly, this display of bad loser\\'s spirit would have been more efficient had it not been immediately followed by another one where he throws his office desk from the window, encouraged by his roommate, an imaginary \\'literature\\' student played by Paul Bettany and it seems like the writer was already preparing us for weirdness. This is a film that would have benefited from less spectacular stunts, no matter how supposedly true to Nash\\' life they were.\\n\\nSo, once the article about governing dynamics is published and made a name out of Nash, the film makes a chronological leap where we find him as an MIT teacher. He there meets Alicia, a beautiful student, played by Jennifer Connelly, and if not original, the chemistry is believable. This is where something derails the narrative again, once you get the point that mathematics won\\'t play a part to the story, you accept to get to the intimate life, but then for some reason, the writer decides it\\'s time for us to get to the piece of resistance. Then the film focuses on subplots involving a mysterious agent from Ministry of Defense (Ed Harris) assigning Nash to thwart a Russian plot by finding patterns in newspapers. Then the film turns into some sort of copycat-political thriller with chase sequences and shootouts, that aren\\'t even supposed to be real.\\n\\nThe treatment of schizophrenia is so visible, logic and structured that the whole thing loses its credibility, it\\'s on the same level as \\'Inception\\' or the Matrix while I wish it was a bit more like \\'Pi\\', or something that could really be perceived as mental internal, it is a biopic after all. Not that the film is always about Nash\\'s hallucinations but even the rest is an uneven experience, it starts with elements of abstraction that makes you penetrate in the world of Nash, his fascination for patterns, in the sky, but then we\\'re plunged in a succession of archetypal situations that occupy so much of the story every other character becomes just an observer of Nash\\' deterioration, even Alicia becomes the obligatory long suffering wife without any subtlety. How about having the insight of the one sane person who was the closest to Nash, his wife?\\n\\nHer performance was good enough to earn her an Oscar but it\\'s not the same complexity as in her \"Requiem for a Dream\". As for Nash, we don\\'t see the math genius but the victim of a severe mental condition, but it\\'s handled in such a way it\\'s difficult to care about it. The film is well acted, well directed, but I\\'m not sure it does justice to the legacy of a man reduced for almost half the film to things that didn\\'t even happen. As spectacular as they were, I don\\'t think they belonged to the film, and maybe, quoting Nash who commented on a bad tie, and after having \\'enjoyed\\' other Goldman\\'s screenplays, there might be a pattern explaining how bad his narrative choices are.

Some may take exception to this but I feel that the changes serve a valid dramatic purpose. Additionally, the means of portraying Nash\\'s mental state required some artistic license. Again, I feel that this is handled effectively, though who really knows if it\\'s particularly reflective of Nash\\'s actual experiences?\\n\\nIn any case, the story is an involving one that spans many years. The factual basis provided an intriguing foundation for screenwriter Akiva Goldsman to construct a script that puts the viewers in Nash\\'s shoes. The paranoid atmosphere of 1950\\'s America supplies an ideal backdrop for Nash\\'s unravelling sanity while the aftermath is just as interesting. It should be noted that Goldsman was rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts.\\n\\nOf course, much of the credit for bringing Nash to life must go to Russell Crowe. Fresh off his Oscar win for \"Gladiator\", Crowe found himself nominated for an Oscar for the third year in a row, this time for perhaps the best performance of his career. He wasn\\'t on his own, though. The lovely & talented Jennifer Connelly took home an Oscar for her portrayal of Nash\\'s devoted wife. The supporting cast wasn\\'t bad either, featuring Ed Harris & Paul Bettany in memorable roles along with the likes of Judd Hirsch, Christopher Plummer & Adam Goldberg.\\n\\nRon Howard\\'s direction is solid, as usual, though I\\'m not convinced that he deserved to win the Oscar that year over some very tough competition. Nevertheless, \"A Beautiful Mind\" is a well directed film, both visually and performance-wise. The Oscar-nominated score by James Horner is also notable, as is the Oscar-nominated makeup that convincingly aged Crowe & others over the course of decades.\\n\\nAll in all, \"A Beautiful Mind\" is an effective film that ranks as one of Ron Howard\\'s best in a career studded with several crowd-pleasers. Arguments could certainly be made for other films as being more deserving of 2001\\'s Best Picture Oscar but the movie was by no means undeserving. Just don\\'t go into it expecting stringent adherence to the facts. ', '8']\n",

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published Theory of Games and Economic Behavior. In it, John won Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory-- has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.\\n\\nThis sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the New York Times, the American Economic Review, and a variety of other publications.

Whether it be Rush, Apollo 13, Frost/Nixon, or A Beautiful Mind, he has a knack for representing real people well while also adding some movie magic in there as well.\\n\\nThe first time I watched A Beautiful Mind I was blown away by it. Not only did I think all of the actors did a tremendous job sinking their teeth into each role, but I couldn't believe how fascinating John Nash's life was. This is a man was a student at Princeton and made significant contributions to the world of mathematics and economics (including proposing several theories and equations), all while being diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic.\\n\\nRussell Crowe gives one of his best performances as John Nash, in what also may be his most challenging. Crowe has to make it believable that he's both one of the brightest minds in the world but also someone who is seriously struggling with mental illness. He has great chemistry with his love interest, Alicia Nash, played by Jennifer Connelly. In fact, I think this film is a better romance than it is a biopic. Connelly, who won an Oscar for playing Alicia, is a revelation here. She had impressed in previous films, but there's something about her balancing the sweetness of Alicia's personality with her turmoil filled personal life.\\n\\nI think the main issue with A Beautiful Mind is its pace. At 138 minutes, it's right about at the length of your usual bio-drama, but it doesn't feel like it. The film moves at a really slow pace, especially before we realize what Nash is going through mentally. Part of the reason for this is that I found it hard to approach the complexities of his work. The story is interesting, but I can't say I knew exactly what was going on half the time. If the film would have found a way to make all the equations and theories dumbed down for the general audience, the film would have felt much smoother.\\n\\nOverall, the film is well done. I love James Horner's score, Roger Deakin's cinematography is beautiful, as is the romance between Connelly and Crowe, but I think it lacks in re-watchability and pacing.\\n\\n+Romance\\n\\n+Score\\n\\n+Strong performances\\n\\n+Extraordinary story\\n\\n-But difficult to follow at times\\n\\n8.5/10 \", '8']\n",

As Nash becomes obsessed with his work, wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) begins to wonder whether or not John is truly \"working\" at all. To say any more would completely ruin the plot.\\n\\nI could write an essay on why this movie is so great, but to do so would give away key plot details that would ruin the experience for you. Suffice it to say, though, that there are plot twists that you won\\'t see coming even if you know that some are coming! Plus, thanks to the direction of Ron Howard, this is the kind of movie that really isn\\'t even about the \"twist\". It is more about the extraordinary life of Mr. Nash.\\n\\nThe acting in \"A Beautiful Mind\" is also top-notch. As I\\'ve said in other reviews of movies starring Crowe, I cannot recall him EVER turning in a bad performance on screen. I mean, the same guy who can play a Gladiator in one movie and and boxer in another (\"Cinderella Man\") can almost effortlessly (although I\\'m sure it isn\\'t) transform himself into a much more cerebral role here. Co- stars Connelly and Harris play nice supporting roles as well, especially Connelly as Nash\\'s wife who quite literally cannot believe what she is seeing from her husband on occasion.\\n\\nThus, I consider \"A Beautiful Mind\" to rank among my personal favorites.

It really helps the audience see through his eyes, and understand the way he feels about certain subjects.\\n\\nNow, the only negative I had with film is the plot progression. Some people can see this film as very boring for the first act, yet also unpredictable. I thought the movie was going to go one way, until it took a 360 about halfway through and really threw me off. I actually had to sit and process it a little before continuing on with the film. This a good thing, once the credits role, but for the first portion of the movie, and when the twist occurs, it makes you wondering whether or not the film should've played out this way.\\n\\nOverall, A Beautiful Mind is a great film, and a must see for most people. Ron Howard does amazing again, especially with Russell Crowe, Paul Bettany, Jennifer Connelly, and James Horner working with him to create his best film since Apollo 13.

A brilliant, but antisocial man. The movie starts of with him going to the university where he meets Charles, who becomes his best friend. At some point in the movie he gets offered a job, to work in cryptography. He accepts this job but it turns out to be a bad decision which changes his life...\\n\\nThe movie is directed by Ron Howard, believe me or not, that is the same guy who did \"The Da Vinci Code\". I was very surprised too. It was very well directed in comparison to \"The Da Vinci Code\". I didn\\'t like that movie at all, but I still gave it a 6/10 because I liked the book. The cinematography was also handled great. It was done by \\'legend\\' Roger Deakins. This man is just amazing at his job every shot was really beautiful. The scene I personally thought was the best cinematographed was the scene where Charles and Nash were standing on the roof, how the camera flowed was just so pretty, the dialogue in this scene was also very good, this was my favorite scene. But not only in this scene is the movement of the camera good, this applies to almost all of the scenes. Which has a pretty outcome. What I didn\\'t really like was how they used the orange collar scheme. it did make the movie look old, which I think they were aiming for, but I personally think it didn\\'t look too good. The creativity put in to this movie was also very good. Like when Nash and Alicia are outside of a building and look up to the sky. Then Nash says that she must pick a shape and she tells him the shape of a umbrella, what I liked about this scene is how they lit up the stars that formed the umbrella. The also do this at times when Nash is cracking codes. It was overall cool to see how he unravels the codes. The make- up was very good, how they made Crowe look old was just so good.\\n\\nThe acting of the movie was also amazing. Russel Crowe was by far the best. He played John Nash. He did an amazing job to portray him, and you could really believe that he was antisocial. You can see this in the beginning of the movie very well. Jennifer Connelly played Alicia. Alicia was the love interest of Nash. She was also good. She was a worried wife to him, and she nailed acting like one. Paul Bettany. His character I liked the most. He played Charles, a funny, caring, friend. And when he turned out to not be real I was shocked (a bit more about this twist further on in the review). Paul was also very good. Ed Harris played the \\'Boss\\' off Nash when he started to work in cryptography. He was also good, but he was my least favorite character. There is also Adam Goldberg, he also played in the TV-show Fargo and in Saving Pravite Ryan. In this movie he did a good acting job, even though I think he was better in Fargo. You also have some smaller role characters, and they did the best they could. Overall the acting was good, but I was more blown away by Russel Crowes performance\\n\\nThe script was good too. You can see this, by how easily you are convinced that Nash is antisocial. You can also feel the friendship that has bred between Nash and Charles, which makes it more heartbreaking to see him say goodbye to Charles. They also had some great chemistry. There were also some funny moments that broke the dramatic tone, but this isn\\'t necessarily a bad thing. The twist in the middle of the movie was just mind blowing, I didn\\'t see that coming, but I could have guessed. Because Charles was never at parties (in the beginning of the movie) but then he suddenly appeared out of nowhere. I definitely liked the twist, because it wasn\\'t anything really predictable, like it is in most movies. But if you did some research you also could have known that it was all fake. Because of the writing and acting, you almost immediately cared about Nash, whereby it wad more sad to watch.

I just finished the movie 3 minutes ago, and all my goals and plans for today are washed away, I can\\'t think about anything but my love for this film.\\n\\nNo need to add to many comments you probably have read here, but Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly rock.In social life, nerds and inconsiderate people like John Nash are the first combatants that are cleared out of the colosseum, but the stunning acting of Russell and Jennifer convinces the audience that the love between John Nash and Alicia Nash can\\'t be explain by our shallow knowledge about falling in love. They are above the level of attractive girls falling for attractive boys, their nature, or something deeper, is drawing them closer and closer to form a romance that touch the world with its purity and depth. Alicia didn\\'t marry John for money, safety or his appearance, because John here looks like a wrinkled bear. Alicia loved him because he was where she belonged, and the first appearance of Alicia punched the concept in me that she knew it as soon as she saw him, because she was staring at him with sparkling beauty. It was love at first sight.\\n\\nThe settings were also cool, the scene where Alicia cracked open the door of John\\'s office and the cottage near their house is mind-blowing. The scene of numbers glowing and floating out of screens in the Pentagon and from the magazines lying on the floor was also a genius representation of intelligence, exceeding the BBC drama Sherlock Holmes. It actually makes no sense because they are just random clippings of random magazines, but it also force the audience into believing there are some secret messages embodied in these random paragraphs because we are seeing this from a genius\\' perspective, it\\'s adjusted to a level of intelligence beyond ours. But after seeing the abandoned building from Alicia\\'s eyes, who was a sign of sanity, in which the windows that shadows were escaping and dogs are barking, were sealed with cement. The pile of envelops tell both Nash and us, that the whole conspiracy thing isn\\'t real, it\\'s as ridiculous as the 911 being plotted by the US government or the world tricking you into believing that you have a nose.\\n\\nThe music is most effective tool the movie uses to mark out the climaxes and the turning points.

The death of John and Alicia Nash in a traffic accident focused my mind on the review.\\n\\nWhat I took away from my reviewing of A Beautiful Mind was Nash as played by Russell Crowe being surprised by the varied use of the Game Theory principles in the world of commerce. It makes the hackneyed attempt to explain this theory by Goldsman make it look even more inept. I actually find myself thinking of how Game Theory applies in real life with things like sport rights television auctions.\\n\\nOnce upon a time one channel would buy up exclusive rights to soccer. A winner take all attitude which presumably led to underhand tactics such as bribery.\\n\\nNow you have packages sold to various TV channels, which means several channels in one country will show live soccer at different times and days with another channel having highlights and the soccer authorities maximising their revenue. The poor punter gets even more poorer though having to pay more in subscription payments!\\n\\nOn the weekend that Nash died I even thought if Game Theory could apply in things like peace talks.

            "171 ) [' At first glance, A Beautiful Mind is an inspiring tale about a \"genius\" mathematician who struggles with severe mental problems. And as long as we can focus on that first glance, the film provides compelling entertainment. I found myself caught up in the movie. Director Ron Howard (Splash, Parenthood) delivers an intriguing story about a man struggling to maintain clarity as his prodigious powers of imagination bring him inspiration, delusion, true love, and trouble. How rare is this? A film out of Hollywood in which the hero\\'s most heroic endeavour involves restraint and self control! But A Beautiful Mind presents itself as the true story of John Nash, whose mathematical breakthroughs have apparently changed the world. And there\\'s the rub. I came away from A Beautiful Mind feeling inspired to learn more about this fascinating character. And the farther I moved from the movie, the more I began to see it for what it is: a fantasy, at best and at worst, a rip-off game by con-artist. Strong accusations? I suppose so. And for the record, I don\\'t expect films that are \"based on a true story\" to be 100% factual. It\\'s impossible to tell a story that is entirely true to its inspiration; we all invent fictions in order to convey aspects of the truth that are most important to us. But shouldn\\'t movies that claim to be \"based on actual events\" seek to bear some resemblance to those \"actual events\"? Is it too much to ask that the film makers and storytellers be reasonable in their embellishments? Watching this film, we endure the hardship of John Nash\\'s mental problems right alongside him. Howard, who has proved time and time again that he can build a decent, workmanlike motion picture does his typically adequate job of telling the story. And the great Russell Crowe brings a lot to the production. Crowe, who deserved an Oscar for his work in The Insider (but received one for Gladiator instead, alas!) is fantastic. He transforms himself into this staggering, bewildered, tormented soul. In spite of a bland script, he gives us glimpses of a hurting spirit, an alienated boy, incapable of discerning the difference between fantasy and reality. It\\'s hard to watch. As we watch Nash grow old, Crowe\\'s performance and make up (some of the finest ageing make up I have ever seen) deliver a completely convincing human being burdened with challenges most of us have never imagined. Nash is a character who isn\\'t comfortable with what we consider \"normal life.\" In social circles, he\\'s brusque and rude. Around women, he\\'s awkward and downright insulting. At work, he ridicules the \"great ideas\" of his genius peers, calling their work \"derivative\" and declaring, \"There\\'s not an original or innovative idea in any of it.\" Nash\\'s troubles stem from schizophrenic hallucinations, and A Beautiful Mind is the story of his struggle to reject false realities and hold fast to what is true. But he is calm, collected, and right at home whenever he\\'s breaking codes and solving mathematical problems. We can see the potential in him, and so, in spite of his unkindness, we find Nash sympathetic. We root for him when he is drawn into working for a harsh and manipulative government operative (Ed Harris.) And we also root for him to overcome his social awkwardness when an admiring student (the radiant Jennifer Connelly) starts courting him. As a result, A Beautiful Mind stands apart from most Hollywood hero epics, in which we are told again and again to obey our hearts and our impulses. This story dares to suggest that the path to fulfilment and peace requires that we deny of self-destructive impulses. This is the most resonant chord in the film\\'s dissonant symphony. At its heart, A Beautiful Mind is a parable about self-control, and about becoming a better person through the transforming of our minds.It\\'s a shame, then, that the movie contradicts itself.For the sake of crowd pleasing, Howard abandons the thought of restraint when Nash is tempted into romance by a student named Alicia. The allure of a glamorous romance gets the better of him, and their plunge into passion is portrayed without any question about the propriety of such behaviour. Further, we are baited into cheering when Nash lashes out at those around him, because it makes for good spectacle. ', '9']\n",

From the writing of the screenplay to the cast and crew, this film is top caliber and worthy of all of the Oscar nominations and accolades bestowed upon it. This movie is at its best when viewed the first time, but each time after I seem to notice something that I had not before. That is the genius of this film.\\n\\nDirector Ron Howard leads a talented team of actors and actresses to deliver one of my all-time favorite movies. John Nash (actor Russell Crowe) is a mathematician who is battling the debilitating mental illness, Schizophrenia. Alicia Larde (actress Jennifer Connelly) is a student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T), where John Nash is a professor, who falls in love with and eventually becomes his wife.\\n\\nThere actually two good stories intertwined to make A Beautiful Mind the classic that it is sure to be. The first is the life and accomplishments of Nobel Prize, for Economics, winner John Nash; the second is insight into the disease schizophrenia, and the effect it has on John and those closest to him. Similar to Teddy Daniels, Leonardo DiCaprio\\'s character in the movie Shutter Island, this disease takes over their lives. Eventually removing the separation between reality and fantasy.\\n\\nMy first insight into the quality of this film appeared when John Nash, a self-described loner, is attending Princeton for Graduate school; he is housed with a roommate named Charles, (actor Paul Bettany). Charles is boisterous and out-going, where Nash is the serious workaholic. Charles is also a delusion of John\\'s mental illness. Throughout his time in the film, Charles is ingrained into the scenes, whether it is playing pool or standing outside the Helinger\\'s office, Hellinger is played by Judd Hirsch. The nuance I did not notice until the second viewing is that Charles, and similarly with the other delusions, only interacted with John Nash. Even when Marcee, Charles\\' niece (actress Vivien Cardone), was running around the Princeton campus chasing birds, none of the pigeons took flight in fear of her. The timing and tempo of the movie, made these characters appear as they are the same as John and Alicia themselves. It made later characters, Dr Rosen, more difficult to discern as real or not.\\n\\nAnother quality of the film that I enjoyed was the use of invisible sound. There is a point in the film where Alicia is gathering clothes from a clothes line, she hears what appears to be cryptic radio chatter. These noises appear to be coming from the inside of a small garage at rear of the property. When she goes to investigate, she discovers just how far along her husband\\'s illness has progressed. He was supposed to be taking medication to keep his illness under control. With this discovery, she knows he has stopped taking his medications and that theirs sons life is in danger.\\n\\nOne of the more memorable moments of the film is a conversation that John has with Charles atop the roof of their dormitory at Princeton. It happens the day they find out that they are roommates; John is explaining to Charles why he isn\\'t good with people. John tells Charles, \"The truth is, I don\\'t much like people And they don\\'t much like me\". Later in the conversation, they delve into why John is so driven to work as hard as he does; John states, \"find a truly original idea. It\\'s the only way to distinguish myself. Only way to truly matter\". To me, those are very powerful insights about John Nash. The fact that he is having this conversation with a person created from his illness is telling to the seriousness of his disorder. John graduates Princeton and gets a job, teaching at the Wheeler Lab, on the campus of M.I.T. During his time there, he is contracted to do cryptography work for the Department of Defense (DoD). After finishing one of his jobs decrypting Russian code, John meets Parcher (actor Ed Harris). Parcher seeks Johns help decrypting more Russian code to help foil a plot to detonate a mobile nuclear device on US soil. Parcher, like Charles, is a product of John\\'s schizophrenia. Where Charles seemed to befriend John, Parcher seemed to use patriotism and fear to get Nash to do what he needed him to do.\\n\\nEventually, with the help of Alicia and Dr. Rosen (actor Christopher Plummer) John comes to realize that Chalres, Marcee and Parcher are not flesh and blood, but part of his illness. This is the turning point in the lives of John and Alicia. Up to this point, John has been in denial of the diagnosis from Dr. Rosen, even so far as to claim Dr. Rosen is a Russian doctor trying to silence him. John almost drowns his son in the bath tub, claiming that Charles was watching him; then he shows Alicia out of the way as he thinks Parcher is about to shoot her for treason. When faced with a return to the mental hospital for more treatment, John tells Alicia that he now knows that these people are not real, he explains to her, \"I know they are not real, Marcee never ages\".\\n\\nThrough all of the highs and lows that are John Nash\\'s life, there is Russell Crowe giving a superb performance. All of the symptomatic subtleties, from the unusual walk to the way he talks and averts his eyes; Russell Crowe is most deserved of his Oscar nomination. His portrayal, of both, John Nash and of a man battling a mental illness would be worthy of a nomination for either performance. ', '9']\n",

Maybe it would help out someone:\\n\\n1- Biographically: I\\'ve read that the real John Nash had an entirely different story. Please tell me would you take the history and life of a man and change it entirely, deceiving a lot of people and mutilating history to make a movie ?! Couldn\\'t you change the names and say that it was \"inspired\" bu a true story ?! Was it that hard or was it not at appealing and interesting ?! So I agree with everyone out here bashing out this movie for being that inaccurate and deceiving.\\n\\n2- Regarding the fictional love story: it was a little real. When you love someone with all your heart and senses, Hollywood -in a lot of other movies- would be selling you lies. The reality is that even the most romantic couples with the most beautiful love stories ever suffer a lot, fight but stick around. So, it was to some degree realistic.\\n\\n3- Regarding the mental illness: I\\'ve had a share in my life of watching and suffering from mental and psychological disorders.\\n\\nSome people here say it was very unrealistic and a fairy tale. Those people didn\\'t pay enough attention to a lot of details in the movie like the baby who would drown or the people making fun of the professor. So I disagree, it showed much truth, although not in every aspect.\\n\\nThere\\'s a very important aspect that was very disrespected in the movie: the Psychiatrist\\'s image and the medications, which I overlooked because that might be the case with some of the patients who weren\\'t taught how medications would help or have had experiences with bad psychiatrists.\\n\\nA point I found ridiculous and offensive to a great extent, however, was how mental illnesses were portrayed as if a patient with some strong will would overcome them without hospitalization, psychiatric help or medication, just his \"heart\" as pointed by the wife in the movie. This was utterly stupid, this is a disease who sick people should be taught how to cope with, or in other words, a state of mind that you have to learn to live with.\\n\\nHowever, there\\'s a very important aspect clarified here: disorders are not things you have to get rid of or cure, rather than states of mind or in other words, chronic cases, medication should help in some cases, therapy would help greatly too in a lot of cases, and you have to cope with it. Pain makes the most beautiful and the wisest people as I have seen in my life, especially mental and psychological pain, and if the patient/individual knew how to learn from it.\\n\\n4- Technical Details: The acting was marvelous and the soundtrack stood out. The direction overall could have been a little better and of course, the writing is really criticized for all the deception.\\n\\nOverall, a movie recommended and shows a lot of reality for some people, but is a sorrow to see it transform true people\\'s stories into fabrications.

As all but an expert on this topic, I'm in no position to assess whether the film is realistic and respectful to actual patients, but bringing people closer to the minds of schizophrenics and other mentally ill by making a star-studded Hollywood film out of their perspective is rating praise already.\\n\\nRon Howard realized a great mixture of drama, romance, action, and humour with A Beautiful Mind, something many directors attempt to do nowadays, clearly resulting from the award-winning prospect it brings along, but only very few succeed in. Story-wise, the film is immensely entertaining, touching, and just as beautiful as its title suggests. Another major merit of the four-time Oscar winner is its lead actor Russell Crowe, going from heroic action star in Gladiator to socially awkward genius in just two years. He performs extraordinarily in both productions, but his portrayal of the real-life figure John Nash is a far greater achievement. His on-screen partners do wonderful work as well, even if some of the characters do conform to stereotypes.\\n\\nThe film's cinematography is of no lesser quality, capturing the past times the story is set in in gorgeous colours and imaginative shots, such as Paul Bettany defenestrating a desk out in Princeton's snowed campus or the seasons passing outside while John is working on the theory of his lifetime. All of that is accompanied by a James Horner score as melodic and fitting as hardly any other in film history and one that is also a pleasure to listen to on its own.\\n\\nThus, A Beautiful Mind is a more than deserving Best Picture winner at the Oscars and a film worth watching more than once. \", '9']\n",

His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates \"every man for himself\", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. This leads to a new concept of governing dynamics which Nash develops and publishes. On the strength of this he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him. He considers his regular duties at MIT uninteresting and beneath his talents, so he is pleased to be given a new assignment by mysterious supervisor, William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense, to look for patterns in magazines and newspapers in order to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive about searching for these hidden patterns. He meets Alicia and marries while working at the US Department.

Much like the imaginary friend out of Fight Club, but it was really him. And his niece too, fair enough. Believable delusions. An intelligent man could fall for that. Only problem is that neither of them ever age. But that can be argued around.\\n\\nThe problem came with the Department of Defence delusion.\\n\\nNow, fair enough, he could be called to work for the Pentagon. That kind of thing happens, and they often call members of the public to help them out. We all know that that happens, and a mathematician being called in to do code breaking is not out of the question.\\n\\nBeing asked to decipher newspaper codes is fair enough too. It is well documented that spy agencies use newspapers to send encrypted messages. But they use advertising - not articles. The complexity of getting a journalist involved is virtually unheard of in the intelligence community. But the idea of entire newspapers across 20 or 30 publications all publishing fake parts of articles to send encoded messages is a level of complexity that just simply wouldn\\'t happen. One corrupt journalist maybe. But not that many. It just isn\\'t logical.\\n\\nIf he was just looking at advertising, fair enough. From what I have read, they usually use \"lost in love\" adverts to send messages. It was even shown on \"Mission Impossible\". It is easy as pie to put advertising like that in, you can do it anonymously and nobody checks what you put in. You could also put in fake used car ads and other kinds of advertising. But not articles.\\n\\nNot only was he looking in the wrong area, but the level of what he was looking at was all wrong too. In \"Mission Impossible\" they used newspapers to say that they were safe and in the prescribed safe house. In \"Kick Ass\" they used a website to say that they needed help. That is the kind of thing that thy are going to put in - not talking about where to bomb. Things of that level of security would be done behind closed doors face to face. It just isn\\'t believable.\\n\\nAnd John Nash was a smart man so why didn\\'t he work that out? That delusion was unbelievable. And I can\\'t believe that he would fall for it. If it was to try to find bombers when they got out, fair enough. Trying to find bombers when they got out, using advertisements, fair enough. But just the level, well, surely he knew enough about the secret service to know that that just isn\\'t believable.\\n\\nAnd the thing is that once he was shown evidence he should have been convinced - yet he still fell for it again. Smart enough fellow but he fell for it in spite of evidence. The evidence couldn\\'t have been planted.\\n\\nThe other thing is that the Department of Defence delusion was not a happy one. It was an upsetting delusion. When he discovered that his friendly roommate was a delusion, it would have upset him as that happiness would not be there. But on discovering that the horrible Department of Defence guy was fake he should have been happy. But he was not. Not happy because he is not as important? But he should have at least been happy that his life was not in danger.\\n\\nThe only positive part was that he had managed to treat his illness without medication or help from anyone else. We know that this is possible with regular physical illnesses like the flu, and it is very encouraging to think that he could have done that.\\n\\nOnly problem is that it isn\\'t true. In spite of refusing medication, he still went back to hospital several times since he began trying to treat his mental illness without medication.\\n\\nNot a good movie, and I feel a bit sad for people that fell for this.

Others are engulfed in their own realities as it took many years later for anyone to recognize his need for psychiatric assistance. Associated with these episodes you can see another storyline incorporated as viewers become aware of other\\'s reaction to what is socially acceptable of the time. Although criticism and backlash may be less harsh than our current societal tendencies, Nash suffers from stigmas throughout the rest of the film. Each character faces their own reality, and deviation from what is thought to actually exist, to what actually exists. This film similarly relates to the movie, Fight Club, where an imagination of a counterpart and friend, alter the realities of many other individuals. When Nash suddenly becomes introduced to a young student Alicia, his social limitations serve him well by giving him an endearing and mystifying quality. As the film progresses you are drawn into his secret purpose of decoding cryptography. One becomes excited at his possible discovery and chance of leaving even more social woes behind in his rise to hero status. Ironically his very worst stigma, social awkwardness, is what saves his relationships and his life, but in doing so Nash makes difficult decisions about his treatment. Finally getting close to Alicia and securing their love, allowed someone to finally focus and see an unhindered view into Nash\\'s mind. Crowe and Connelly give suburb performances when considering the emotional state in which they must become a part of. Crowes interpretation on one\\'s reality breaking and social awkwardness is displayed brilliantly through his jerky movements, disheveled appearance, almost vacant eyes, and sometimes mumbling dialogue. Connelly\\'s performance of a wife trying dutifully to support her husband makes one want to break down right along beside her. When she gets angry, becomes concerned, feels lonely, the viewer feels her emotions. Her downcast eyes and her posture begin to sag with the weight of her emotions. We feel her pain and hope for her to be strong for Nash, but also hope for her happiness and freedom of safety. Two techniques I viewed at associated well with the theme were lighting and angle. Lighting was very subdued, echoing the recesses of his mind. Nash constantly focuses on the task, the goal, not the excitement of the journey and other surroundings. Various times when Nash was in Alicia\\'s company, you can understand the change of lighting to a brighter shade as he was happier, not trapped within the limitations of his mind, enjoying the moment. Angle was also very important to the film, as many times you can see how the camera follows him and his unusual actions, or the angle cuts to how someone is socially judging his actions. In addition, many of his earlier public scenes with his schizophrenic counterparts were filmed without his other peer\\'s taking notice, so not only they but the viewer wasn\\'t able to immediately establish anything was wrong. Regardless of whether one believes in the process of medicine to overcome your own realities, one can safely say the definition of reality is very different for every person. ', '6']\n",

It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the true story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. Vivien Cardone, whose age was only in the single-digit column when the movie was produced, was outstanding as the little girl Marcee Herman who was taken with him; the character Marcee herself was a phantasm. Paul Bettany was excellent as the practically-vicious Charles, Nash's roommate; Charles himself was a phantasm. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as Nash's shock treatment and his cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. It was another great feat for producer Ron Howard, and, of course, for Universal, Dreamworks, and Imagine Productions.

The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in \"Mind\".

Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis\\'s character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash\\'s schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War.

The decision to make Mozart silly and fancy-free was controversial but makes him more relatable and understandable.\\n\\n2. The entire supporting cast is great. Even Elizabeth Berridge, who is usually the Amadeus cast member who gets the most flack, does a great job as Stanzi. She shows Stanzi as a woman who gives Mozart when he needs, whether he needs a friend or a kick in the rear.

For example, Mozart did have a troubled financial situation and connection with his father. He also did have a masked man ask him to write a requiem, and did work himself towards exhaustion, dying from it. He did behave like a child as an adult, having too strict of a childhood.

Salieri, a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), lived his life insanely jealous of his exceptionally gifted counterpart. Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in. His envy has led Salieri to wage a war against the Christ he devoted his life to, and an urgency to bring about the downfall of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\\n\\nAmadeus is a beautifully striking film, thanks in no small part to its reliance on natural lighting. Amadeus was filmed solely using natural lighting and it benefits immensely from this choice. Amadeus taught me that lighting in a film can have the most dramatic impact, even acting as a character on its own. I am moved by the lighting every time I watch the film, and it is my favorite part of revisiting it. Amadeus achieves a curious feat, it is a biopic in which one cares little about biographic inaccuracies. There are no historical records to indicate that the relationship between Salieri and Mozart was contentious as it appears to be on screen, yet, the story is so engaging that the audience is not tallying the mistakes the film makes. It's more than an engaging story, however, that keeps the audience from becoming upset at the miscues the film fires; Amadeus strikes the delicate balance of giving each principle character their due in the film. Mozart and Salieri are deeply flawed, yet gifted individuals and Foreman brilliantly expresses both sides of each man.\\n\\nSalieri makes a deal with God at a young age promising to devote his life fully to Christ in exchange for divine inspiration of his musical compositions. Salieri begins his devotion by solely studying music and vows to remain chaste, exercising extreme monastic-like discipline in his daily life. Salieri is pleased with the gifts he feels have been handed to him by Christ until he becomes aware of the superior expertise of Mozart. Salieri becomes obsessed with the idea of Mozart and anticipates the day in which he can meet the one God has given such musical talent to. When he finally meets Mozart, Salieri is shocked and disgusted by how juvenile the prodigy is. The interesting aspect of Salieri's repugnance is that he is so revolted by Mozart's childlike behavior, yet his fixation on the composer comes across like a son and outshone by his father's (God's) favorite child. Salieri knows he does not possess the talent Mozart does, yet believes himself to be more deserving of the superior talents. He begins to unwind right before the audience's eyes, decomposing from the realization that he has lived a life promised to another, yet, intensely unfulfilled. It is this great multi-layered portrayal of a jilted man that earned F. Murray Abraham an Academy Award for his role as Salieri; the role also won a Tony for Ian McKellen's brilliant portrayal of Salieri on Broadway. F. Murray Abraham played the part wonderfully and deserves each of the many accolades he received for his turn in the role. The standout for me, however, is the multi-faceted Tom Hulce. Hulce plays the childlike, workaholic, unsophisticated, professional composer. The rapid-fire shifts between facets of the boy genius are extremely well-acted by Hulce. A performance that necessitated so many opposite mindsets is no easy feat, yet one Hulce mastered with ease. As brilliant as Abraham and Hulce were in their roles, it would have been interesting to see Ian McKellen and Tim Curry reprising their stage roles in this film. (I wonder why neither were selected to star in the film having given acclaimed performances on Broadway)\\n\\nAmadeus has a myriad of factors that could work against it. The film is three hours long, is narrated, involves heavily on flashbacks, and shows several compositions-operas mostly, of the featured composer's works. Yet, given the issues that may arise from these aspects of the film, Amadeus does not suffer for them. Amadeus is excellently paced, brilliantly illustrated through narrated flashbacks providing an in-depth look at the people involved in the story, and are wonderfully brought to life by seeing the pieces the composers worked so tirelessly on.\\n\\nSalieri referred to Mozart's natural music ability as if he had been picked to take musical dictation from God, this seemed to be supported when Salieri saw original copies of Mozart's work that showed no marks of corrections or signs of error. As Salieri is working with Mozart, he is taking dictation from the ailing Mozart, and having trouble keeping up with him or even understanding what he is to write; Mozart can hear the melodies he is creating in his head, a skill in which Salieri does not possess. It is never clearer than in his final moments with Mozart that Salieri, while being a gifted composer, has nowhere near the natural aptitude of his counterpart, Mozart. Given that the film is told from Salieri's forsaken viewpoint, Amadeus is a narrative that explores the raw emotion of a man who devoted his life to an art form that abandoned him and is the most painfully beautiful illustration of such I have ever seen. \", '10']\n",

The acting is good, particularly from Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham and Elizabeth Berridge. The opera scenes were very well filmed, and to add an air of authenticity, the entire production was done in Prague and the opera scenes were shot at the actual opera house where Mozart's operas were performed. The only bit that was out of place, in my opinion, was the parody of Mozart's operas that Schikander did. It was just vile, along with a scene earlier in the film where Mozart engages in something that should take place in the bedroom betwixt a married (ie. straight) couple. The latter is fortunately brief, while the former is unnecessarily lengthy. But the theatrical cut is better, in my opinion, as I shall explain at length in the following paragraph.\\n\\nHowever, the screenplay fabricates a lot of things about Mozart's life (whilst getting some of them correct). I think that the theatrical cut is better because it does not include a nude scene, which is one of the major historical errors. Salieri leaving in the theatrical cut was more consistent with his characterization in the film rather than making him out to be a lecher (which came out of nowhere in the Director's Cut). In addition, Mozart never fornicated with Salieri's pupil; it was quite the opposite in real life. Another major blunder is Mozart saying that he did not like either Bach or Handel when in fact, Mozart studied with Johann Christian Bach, and also re-arranged and conducted several of Handel's works including the oratorio Messiah.\\n\\nI do not recommend the Director's Cut; while it does add a few interesting scenes, they do not advance the plot in any way, and the nude scene is completely gratuitous, in my opinion. Stick with the two hour, forty minute theatrical cut.\\n\\nThe Theatrical Version is rated PG for crude humor throughout, and some language, and brief sexuality.

But I never really connected to the characters, and that\\'s where it fails for me.\\n\\nWinning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it\\'s safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80\\'s. It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly. I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera\\'s needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce\\'s eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.\\n\\nOf course, Amadeus isn\\'t strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his \"rivalry\" with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart\\'s wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor. These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don\\'t mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.\\n\\nWhat didn\\'t bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well. It\\'s also worth noting that his character isn\\'t all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that\\'s missing from the rest of the film.\\n\\nAnother thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film.

A single note, hanging there, unwavering. Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I had never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God. Director Milos Forman's Best Picture winning drama was indeed a masterpiece. Based on Peter Shaffer's extravagant 1980 Broadway play with the same name. The film tells a fictionalized biography of tortured genius and Viennese child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Also, the story was presented in a way that was very unique at the time. It was through the eyes of fellow jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who finds the deeply crude and childish behavior of Mozart, unworthy of such praise. Driven by his attempt to outshine Mozart, Salieri must find a way to gain the audience of the Austrian Aristocrats, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, a lot of people had complain that this movie wasn't historical accuracy. In my opinion, a lot of this criticize wasn't needed. To the film credit, Amadeus never claims to be a true story. It's normal for films like this, to sometimes diverge from historical facts in order to explore more fundamental and universal human issues and to achieve a dramatic effect. Yet, the film had more fact than fiction than most people are willing to taken. It did a lot of homework to get, as accuracy as possible. So, when I hear, some of the main complains that the critics point out about the film. I had to question, their short-temper justice. I felt like they were misinform. Many of the so-call historical inaccuracies were somewhat true. It's true that Antonio Salieri later claims he killed Mozart. Even Mozart toward the end of his life, swears that he's believe that he been poison, but in terms of Salieri doing it; its indeed historical fiction; due to the fact that most historians dismissed his mad ravings with that of a person whom clearly had his sanity deteriorated & the fact that Mozart fell ill while in Prague on Sept 6. 1791 where Salieri was clearly not there. Another claim, these critics spoke of, is how the film, portray a masked man wanting to commissioned a requiem from him in order to steal his work. In truth, it was very likely at the time for people to anonymously commissioned requiems from famous composers and pass them as them, off; but there was no reason why Salieri needed to. After all, his music was a lot more popular at the time, than Mozart. It wasn't, because Mozart was lazy. It was, because he was a fading child star, who had drug problems which both historians and film critics fail to notice that kept him working. I thought that Tom Hulce's immature performance as Mozart was very accuracy as it was very well documented that the composer had those characteristic traits even if it's a little exaggerated. However, the ever-present, idiotic giggle does get a little too annoying at times. About the fact that Salieri and Mozart were fighting for certain imperial jobs, it was true, but the reason why Mozart was never given a position on the emperor's courts, wasn't, because Salieri's envy of Mozart, but the fact, that Mozart's music doesn't sound typical 'Galant' & he wasn't noble. There was no reason why Salieri really needed to steal his work, as he was rich enough, and Mozart's work was a little too controversial at the time for basing works on Austrian's past banned materials and not being tradition. About Mozart's constant embarrassment of Salieri, such as seducing Salieri's lover, Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole). There is no evidence that Mozart slept with her. In reality, it is very likely that Salieri slept with Catarina, as it was generally known, at the time, that she was his mistress, and if they were still together years after 'The Abduction from the Seraglio'. If anything, Mozart and Salieri were, if not best of friends, at least on peaceable terms with one another, when it comes to sexual and musical conquest. He wasn't a saint at all. He even educated Mozart's younger son Franz Xaver Mozart, after the composer death. While, yes it's true that Mozart's work outlive, Salieri. It wasn't because Mozart work was better than Salieri. It was, because German nationalism began to take shape in Vienna with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars. Italians were often view, as scapegoat of the war since Napoleon was one; thus Italian culture like it's music was somewhat banned from most European cultures during the mid19th century. This short ban, cause hits like Salieri to be nearly forgotten. It wasn't until, the late 20th century that most of Salieri's work was reintroduce into western culture with this film. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish set and period costume design, music, visuals, and its acting. If the film had any faults, it would be the fact that the movie has pacing problems. It's way too damn long. 2h 40min is too much. It could had been cut down. Ultimately, the 1984 awards were monopolized by Amadeus with eight wins: Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art/Set Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup. It became the 7th film in Oscar history to win eight Oscars. Overall: It's visually interesting, has dramatic intrigue acting from F. Murray Abraham, hilarious comedy, and introduced people to a part of history that was phenomenally fascinating and surprising, mostly true. I highly recommended this film. \", '9']\n",

Sure, it has a simple narrative that is easy to follow but it's more driven by the vision and the experience for the audiences over the narrative. Now this movie has gotten some backlash, mainly because of it's depiction of the historical figures. So yeah, although the story might not entirely be focused on telling the exact truth, it does a fine job of blending fiction with reality. Because it does have important scenes that are deemed to be historically accurate or assumed to be. Never the less, the main focal point of this movie isn't to tell the step by step of Mozart's life. But to make it a experience that would draw the audiences in with it's depth and soul. Even the directing style comes of slightly strange when it comes down to it. So the story is told from the perspective of Antonio Salieri who was one of the well known composer during his prime as a composer. But in this film he is depicted as a mediocre composer trying to be more than what he is. Salieri in this comes across as a overly self-righteous, pompous jerk that has a huge jealousy towards the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since Mozart in this film is portrayed as a party guy that loves the ladies and just like enjoying the moment with his lavish spendings. Which kind of makes him a rock star during his time period. And since the demeanor of Antonio Salieri is vastly different from Mozart, Salieri not only makes Mozart his rival but his sworn enemy. Sometimes people like to pick apart and only try to focus on the negative side of someone they are jealous towards and that really shows through Salieri in this. He is a character that will do whatever it takes to bring Mozart down by slowly diminishing Mozart's chances to show his musical talents to the world to see. In this, while Mozart is a musical prodigy Salieri is a mediocre composer that is gifted in scheming, manipulating and has a very cunning persona. It shows the colliding of personalities and the ill intentions of Salieri as he picks apart Mozart. I also found Mozart's focus when it comes to his music and how he enjoyed life and his family to be touching and yet interesting. May it be entirely true or not, the man was a musical genius and his music will continue to carry on for generations. Overall though, this is a intriguing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed despite it being 3 hours. It's quite a depressing film though, so I probably wouldn't pick it up immediately to watch it again.

With humility he thinks \"this genius Mozart must too, be a humble, hard working man who has striven greatly for this level of talent to manifest. Of course Salieri is soon disabused of this fact. Mozart like most true geniuses creates so easily and naturally that he in a way is almost contemptuous of the toil which others must endure, to produce works which pale in comparison with his least trifle.\\n\\nThe film is told in flashback by Salieri at the end of his life, confined in a madhouse, confiding to a young priest. He thinks that his actions lead Mozart to his death and is both proud and tormented by this. He is aware that Mozart is a \"true\" genius. Salieri has been flattered all his life with this word and he too, realizes that his great gift is the ability to discern the real thing when it is before him.

Let me celebrate Your glory through music and be celebrated myself. Make me famous through the world, dear God. Make me immortal. After I die, let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote. In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life, Amen.\" Years later, Salieri, now an Austrian court composer in the service of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), saw with sense of betrayal God\\'s creation of Mozart. He knew Mozart\\'s music was great, and his own was not. This fact alone did not worry him; it was the fact that Mozart was a coarse and vulgar boy. Often, he had talked and prayed to a cross hanging on his wall, but once his contempt overflowed, he gave it one last prayer and gazed at it once last time ablaze in his fireplace:\\n\\nBecause You will not enter me, with all my need for you; because You scorn my attempts at virtue; because You choose for Your instrument a boastful, lustful, smutty infantile boy and give me for reward only the ability to recognize the Incarnation; because You are unjust, unfair, unkind, I will block You! I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.\"\\n\\nIronically, although Salieri named himself virtuous and worthy of being God\\'s \"Incarnation,\" the vulgar Mozart held a closer relationship to God -- even having a certain fear and respect of Him, of which Salieri had none. But taking on the action he had sworn to do, he held Mozart in his deadly grasp, gradually sucking away his money, sanity, life, and finally, his music.\\n\\nWith a perfect balance of words, Shaffer crafted the infamous Salieri, whom F. Murray Abraham played with intensity, and surprised us with his remarkable transition between a bitter, yet free, elderly Salieri and a quiet and calculating, thickly accented younger Salieri. No one -- not even I -- would have thought the two Salieris were played by the same actor. Abraham speaks Shaffer\\'s words with such resonance and a sense of illustriousness that they stand out in our minds, seeming as though his words alone had an impact on history.\\n\\nNever before or after Amadeus had a movie effectively portray an iconic classical music figure without ruining the drama and comedy. Most of us view Mozart as an indomitable demigod-like music figure -- even if we know as a fact that Mozart was crude, barmy and ill-mannered -- but we could never comprehend that Mozart was an actual living vulgarity. Indifferently, Forman and Shaffer tore to shreds the demi-god character of Mozart and gave room for him to shine his crudity. Many have complained about the historical inaccuracies of Amadeus, especially the ending scene where Salieri takes a dictation from Mozart for his Requiem. However, as Shaffer explained in the introduction of his stage play, he changed the ending for dramatic effects. Amadeus is not a biopic; it is a historical-fiction exploring the realms of humanity, hatred and God.\\n\\nForman and Shaffer left many varied and clear-cut messages in Amadeus. Some say Salieri\\'s downfall was caused by either his jealousy or the haughty demand in his childhood prayer, explaining why God attempted to destroy Salieri both great points and interpretations. But I believe that the explanation of God\\'s wrath on Salieri is more objective. In his childhood prayer, he prayed for talent, and \"In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life \" But as none of those qualities were evident in the film, he earned that punishment. But wasn\\'t Salieri\\'s request for a righteous man to have the musical talent an honorable request? Perhaps. And perhaps God did fulfill that request, just through a different, yet pious and talented, Austrian: Franz Joseph Haydn. ', '10']\n",

            "231 ) ['Spoilers Ahead:\\n\\nFirst, to the flaws: yes the insane giggle, trust me in the afterlife Mozart is going to be looking for both Hulce and the screenplay writer. It is both annoying and grossly disrespectful, please, yes, there are some people who say he was a bit of a libertine but don\\'t have him laughing like a child molester! Second, the movie is an hour too long, the new extended addition compounds the difficulty; it really begins to drag near the ending. For those of you avoiding the movie, don\\'t, the operas are shown only in brief snippets, you won\\'t have to sit through extended periods of fat people screeching. I am with you, I adore classical music, most of it, but detest opera. The main reason to watch is Mozart\\'s beautiful music which fills the entire movie. Even in scenes you may not care for, you get to hear some of his most beautiful music. The movie was criticized for its focusing upon Salieri\\'s mortal hatred of Mozart but even more upon the unhistorically supported claim that he murdered him. As a movie reviewer, I am just focusing on the entertainment value of the movie. Abraham gives his signature performance that made him a star. Ironically, though it be Amadeus, Abrahams\\'s Salieri dominates the narrative. The movie delineates him as spiritualizing his mediocrity as some kind of slight by God.\\n\\nWhen he witnesses Mozart\\'s brilliance, paired with his moral debauchery, it sends him over the ledge. Mozart doesn\\'t help things by mocking him in public, as my header alludes to. In a costume ball, someone yells out that challenge to Mozart, who mockingly plays the piano like a cross-eyed retard, culminating in his lifting his cape and loudly breaking wind at the conclusion of a stilted, dumb ass piece of Salieri\\'s music. This is the heart of the movie, the growing enmity of the court favored Salieri, who gets increasingly involved in destroying Mozart. He cuts off his pupils, slanders him to the Emperor, and then, the most doubtful, plans his murder by working him to death dressed in the costume of his dead father: Leopold. This is not an idealized delineation, Hulce plays Mozart as a giant, narcissistic, arrogant child full of contempt for others. His childhood is briefly shown before we meet him testing the archbishop\\'s patience by being late to his own public recital. The next scene, where he opens the doors to his cheering fans, while showing the archbishop his backside, is the quintessence of his personality. The movie follows his gradual decline caused by his extravagance and naivete about court politics.\\n\\nThough Salieri is musically painfully inferior to Amadeus, the latter is commensurately out of his element in the political world where Salieri is beloved by the musically retarded Emperor Joesph the Second. Yes, it is long, the veracity of the ending dubious and Hulce\\'s delineation can seem like almost a parody at times, despite all these flaws, like Immortal Beloved, this is the best Mozart movie we have. Until somebody makes a better one, I recommend it to you. Filled with his music, plenty of humor, usually at Salieri\\'s expense, it was worthy of its Oscar. Abraham dominates the movie with his smoldering envy and burgeoning hatred for,\"My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.\" My favorite scene is at the end, confined to the nut house for claiming he killed Mozart, he pardons all those around him. \"I am the patron saint of mediocrity, I absolve you my child, I absolve you.\" The movie is told in flashbacks from a room where the local priest has come to test him about his claim of killing Amadeus.\\n\\nHis hatred reaches such depths that he commissions Mozart to write a Requiem that he plans on stealing posthumously and playing at his funeral, as he laughs at him. The priest looks on horrified,\"A wonderful mass of Death, played for Mozart by his dear friend Salieri and God forced to listen. Powerless to stop it, me laughing at Him.\" For all its myriad flaws, my friends, it at least did not attempt to distill a musical legend to his pants and who they were blazing for like Immortal Beloved. It is closer to a true biography; I gave Immortal an eight, mainly for Oldham\\'s excellent performance. Still A Good Movie.

It's indescribable. F. Murray Abraham brings an astonishing performance, and so does Tom Hulce. The majority of the scenes are on the comic side, but those dramatic ones aren't missing. Wolfie (Tom Hulce), like his wife Costanze (Elizabeth Berridge) called him, is that childish mastermind, who modesty doesn't apply to throughout all the movie, yet it gives you joy watching him perform. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) on the other hand is portrayed in two personas: young and old. They're quite different from each other. The young one is his position as a court composer for the emperor (Jeffrey Jones), and his old one is that of the narrator of the story. The emperor, now that I mentioned it, is a pulled-back, not-so-obvious character and his performance is hilarious, in my view. What's really about this movie that shouldn't be missed are the operas. Having heard them live is one thing, but this cinematic experience is unforgettable, hence: an omnixperience! \", '10']\n",

If you\\'re responsive to personal tragedies, then this movie will leave an impression on you.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the true brilliance of Amadeus? There was no battle, duel, or any kind of marvelous chase, but some scenes radiated more energy and tension than the final battle of Avatar. This is where you witness the directing skills of Mr. Forman. He was able to create epic scenes with the simplest tools. For example, the scene where Salieri reads Mozart\\'s compositions occupies a prominent place in the hall of extraordinary movie moments.\\n\\nEvery character was prepared with meticulous care, even the seemingly insignificant imperial counselors formed separable individuals. A simple word or a tiny gesture was completely enough to figure out their personality. Portrayal of the emperor was another great implementation. He always wanted to appear educated and smart, but he couldn\\'t even make a single statement without his crew\". Tom Hulce\\'s Mozart was clearly a new approach. It helped to build up the story, and served as a perfect symbol of divine injustice. However, everyone\\'s performance was dwarfed by F. Murray Abraham. I\\'ve never seen anyone who is capable of expressing amazement and hatred at the same time. He was balancing on this imaginable thin line through his facial expressions so well. Not a single word was necessary to see inside his head and understand his feelings. A very complex and well-built character with a sad and unfair destiny.\\n\\nEach concert ensures opportunities for the music to prevail and presents the real beauty of classical music. During these shows you can actually feel energy that flows through your body. These passionate composers are in love with music, and this obsession is a curse and a gift at the same time. However, the music was just the frame that ensured a breeding ground for the conflict to unfold. Forman could have presented a rivalry between two carpenter, and it would have made sense too.\\n\\nThose who keep complaining about the historical inaccuracy didn\\'t get the point. Amadeus\\'s goal is not to be a tribute to Mozart, but to be a tribute to the people who were in the wrong place at the wrong time\". You can work your ass off, but at a certain level, work can\\'t beat talent. Salieri was clearly the Patron Saint of Mediocrity\". During a lifetime everyone feels at least once what it feels like to be mediocre (at something where you want to be the best), and Salieri\\'s personal tragedy is a base that people can identify with. However, talent can\\'t stand on it\\'s own. We witness that total lack of respect always leads to self destruction. Mozart\\'s passion for music was visible, but humility can\\'t be replaced by talent. Talent vs. Commitment. Mozart had, what was missing from Salieri, and Salieri had what was missing from Mozart. The perfect combination would be the mix of these two, but the world doesn\\'t work like this.\\n\\nAt some points, it settled down a little bit, but it only lasted a few minutes, which is nothing compared to the length of the movie. It\\'s definitely up there on my top movies list. Even those can appreciate Amadeus, who don\\'t consider themselves a classical music fan. ', '10']\n",

            "238 ) [\"Amadeus, or Loved by God. We view this figure through the historical lens of an ageing and seemingly senile Antonio Salieri, but I am struck by how clearly his memory haunts him, however accurate his representation of Mozart may be. In reality, Mozart was not some genius whose notes came to him as easy as breathing did, but that is how Salieri remembers it. We see how beautifully his recount flows in the editing; how these L cuts create such magnificent sound-bridges which link each period of Salieri's fall and Mozart's rise like a symphony. A crumpled letter from the angry Leopold transitions into the sound scattering a flock of deer as the Emperor proposes his niece as a pupil. Caterina Cavalieri is one minute a student of Salieri, the next inexplicably the star of Mozart's Seraglio, another cruel blow. And in the most evocative scene of them all, where a disbelieving Salieri inspects Mozart's original works, and each turn of the page unveils another masterpiece, and both Salieri's are trapped in ecstasy. F. Murray Abraham's dual roles are masterful; in one he is silent, so caught up in the majesty of these ink-strokes on the page as he trembles, and in the elderly voice-over, recalling the discovery crystal clear, and we know how wrapped up he still is after all these years in conflict, in admiration, in respect, in bitterness and unbearable envy at being passed over by God. See the contempt as the father hums along to the recognisable strings of Mozart's Serenade No. 13. I must admit I too can only recognise one of the three, and so there is a little bit of truth in this dramatisation.\\n\\nWho does God choose? Not some respectable, esteemed genius but a rather crude and vulgar child playing games through the halls. The most iconic part of Hulce's performance is of course the peals of his high- pitched feverish laughter which seem to punctuate the guise of each formal setting that he enters. Some would say it is out of place. I would say that it is highly appropriate for Salieri's tales; the laughter becomes infuriating, and each instance of it only further confirms his anguish and disbelief that such a crass and unrefined brat be gifted with such musical genius. This is God mocking him with the same giggle, divine injustice personified.\\n\\nIn its production design the film is of course gorgeous. The sets and costumes are detailed alike, bathed in natural light, and made alive. We see how exquisite dress is required for symbolising status, these great billowing gowns, ridiculous wigs and enormous headpieces, but it is the act of removing them that we get a more authentic characterisation, as seen in the nervously determined way in which Constanze offers up her body to boost her husband's career (and look at how defiant Salieri is, in refusing and determining he is to beat Mozart fair and square, not by some act of God). In another Director's Cut exclusive, as he plays a jaunty tune to cure a rowdy dog, these simple notes transition into the gorgeous 3rd movement of his 15th Piano Concerto. Other pieces of his work are brilliantly entangled into the drama. The immense, brash opening of Don Giovanni's Overture blasts as we break open the doors to find an elderly Salieri with bloody wrists and an inconsolable heart, wracked by the guilt of his sinful deed in destroying a genius. The same is used as Leopold re-enters atop a staircase in black, and as the same dark foreboding costume by Salieri is used to trigger his composition of his unfinished Requiem, and to loudly announce the death of a father. These moments hit us as abruptly thunderous as they do to Mozart, and his music mourns and weeps for him.\\n\\nAbraham's performance carries each opera, and provides us with an audience proxy by which we appreciate in its extremities. His voice- over is so remarkably tender and the sounds of the symphonies reaches into his storytelling years and years gone by, as he describes what is simply notes on a page with the most unabashed admiration. And there is conflict, the most painful conflict I have ever witnessed on screen. Watch as his eyes shut in bliss upon Mozart's work, and as they scrunch up in petty glee upon a simple yawn. Oh, but he went to each and every one of those five performances. As he tricks Mozart into composing a masterpiece under his own name, he himself becomes entranced by the master at work. He formerly remarked that Mozart's music was as effortless as taking dictation from God, and here he can barely dictate the words coming from a bed-ridden Mozart. But still he is horrified as Constanze demands they cease composing, and lives the rest of his life in utter regret. In one conversation, he advises Mozart to end his operas with a bang, to inform the audience when to applaud. And yet, he knows in his heart that Mozart's music speaks for itself, and that the audience should know, as he so very much knows, when to put their hands together. And as I finished this film, I too knew this feeling. \", '10']\n",

This one gave me everything I wanted. Such is not to say that another great, original Mozart film could not be made. I have too much trust of the creativity of the human race to not believe that. There is just no purpose in doing so. There does not need to be more LOTR films, there do not need to be more adaptions of To Kill a Mockingbird, and there do not need to be more movies about Mr. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\\n\\nIf Forman's other great movie, OFOTCN, is a gloriously humanistic and smartly rebellious, if more than slightly manipulative, knife of a movie, this one is an over-the-top, stylistic, creatively- flourishing, operatic broadsword of an epic. This is the kind of movie that is not just made by a the mind of a director but by his very soul. OFOTCN is 'directed by Milos Forman.' Amadeus is a 'Milos Forman film.'\\n\\nThe film mostly takes place in late eighteen century Vienna. It centers around the lives of two men; the eponymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played expertly and to an Academy Award nomination by Tom Hulce, and Antonio Salieri, played expertly and to an Academy Award win by F. Murray Abraham. The former is depicted as a boorish brat and playboy who can nonetheless compose some of the finest music ever heard by human ears, the later as his opposite: a dedicated musician who is nonetheless consigned to be 'the patron saint of mediocrity.' We follow Salieri and go through his eternal misery of being one of the few people in the world who can fully appreciate Mozart's talent yet being completely unable to replicate it.\\n\\nYes, if you check actual historical accounts, Salieri was not as antagonistic towards Mozart as he is in the movie. But that's not the point of cinema, something that a lot of so-called 'movie fans' don't seem to understand. Yes, I respect and am a fan of Schindler's List and the like. But realism and staying true to actual events is about as essential to a successful film as massive car chases.\\n\\nFilm is about feel. Film is about emotion. Film is about style. Film is about characters. And in all these respects, this film soars. Watching this film is like being an opera at one of the old opera houses of the Old World. The watcher is taken into a world of magic. Not Harry Potter-style magic; there are no magicians casting spells. And not abstract, surreal magic either; there are no volcanoes erupting out of nowhere and covering the world in stylistic lava.\\n\\nNo; this is high-quality stage magic. When I watch this film, I feel like it has gone up to me and said it was going to entertain me like I had never been entertained before and that I had agreed, giving it my time and my imagination, letting it do with them what it pleased.\\n\\nAnd it never disappoints. You start trusting the film, building a relationship with it. It starts to become that rich, adventurous friend we all wish we had, one who would take you with him on his trips around the world. And though this film is by no means a 'perfect movie' (I hate that term, by the way), it never fails you so egregiously that the trust you have formed with the film is broken.\\n\\nEvery part of this film succeeds all the way through, from the acting to the cinematography to the plot to the near-entirely Mozart- composed soundtrack. Like many of Mozart's compositions, it flows so smoothly yet gloriously that you are both dreamily carried along and strikingly aware of the greatness you are witnessing.\\n\\nMy favorite of these aspects is the character of Salieri. Though there is no doubt that he is a villain protagonist, he is also one of the most tragic and unique figures of film. His struggle manages to be both operatically grand and deeply personal. I, for one, was impacted by it on a level that most films cannot even comprehend. I think that in a way, we all feel that way about the geniuses we encounter in our lives.\\n\\nAnd while I chastise movies for fulfilling simple fantasies, I applaud them for creating characters like this, who are in ways personifications of some of our deepest feelings. Though he knows how idiotic the king is for declaring that Mozart uses 'too many notes' (one of my favorite quotes, by the way), he is still wanting the young prodigy to be taken down a peg. He knows that if he had been born with Mozart's gifts, he would have been as famous, if not more famous than his nemesis. But alas, he is not.\\n\\nThere is a scene in which an elderly Salieri play some of his compositions and asks if the priest who has come to hear his 'confession' has ever heard of them. He shakes his head 'no.' Then Salieri plays one of Mozart's pieces and the priest instantly recognizes it. Whether you have seen this film or not, there is no doubt that Mozart was on a different level. So, too, is this film. \", '10']\n",

It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.\"\\n\\nAs I sat there breathless staring at my screen watching this astounding masterpiece while listening to its amazing soundtrack, I couldn\\'t help but relate to F. Murray Abraham\\'s Salieri in his admiration for Mozart and his genius, although my admiration was geared towards Milos Forman\\'s outstanding direction and not on the actual composer himself. What a unique experience this three hour film was for me. Amadeus was a movie I had been putting off mainly because of its extremely long running time and its subject matter: a biopic about a classical music composer, but what a pleasure it was to finally get to experience it for the first time. My concerns about this film couldn\\'t have been so far off because this was such a rich treasure to discover. Amadeus is a timeless film, directed in 1984, it could just as well have been directed today and you wouldn\\'t notice the difference. Everything from the art direction and the set pieces, to the costumes and makeup, to the cinematography could rival any film released this year. I still can\\'t believe this was made in 1984 because it is better than most biopics made today. Just as the central figure of this movie was such a creative and talented composer, Forman proved once again to be way ahead of his peers and was a prodigy director during the 80\\'s. I thought there was no way he could top his marvelous work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo\\'s Nest, but he just did. To say this is one of the biopics ever made is an understatement, because it is one of the best films period. Roger Ebert couldn\\'t have said it better in his review when he wrote, \"the film is constructed in wonderfully well-written and acted scenes -- scenes so carefully constructed, unfolding with such delight, that they play as perfect compositions of words.\" Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, the Oscars oddly awarded the more deserving film that year.\\n\\nAmadeus couldn\\'t have a more suitable and meaningful title, taken from Mozart\\'s middle name which in Latin means \"loved by God,\" the film explores the tormented relationship he had with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), the court composer of Austrian Emperor, Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was so passionate about music that he begged God to make him the best composer the world had known by promising to remain chaste and devoted to Him. We learn this during a confession he is giving to Father Vogler (Richard Frank) after having attempted to commit suicide and confessing to being responsible of Mozart\\'s death decades ago. The film is told in flashback as Salieri narrates what an impression Mozart had made in Vienna during his youth. He was eager to meet this prodigy who God had blessed with such an immense and unique talent, but when Mozart (Tom Hulce) is finally invited to perform at the Emperor\\'s court, Salieri is shocked by what he discovers. Mozart is a childish and vulgar fellow with an obscene giggle that only seemed to mock everything he believed about God\\'s immaculate and pure music. Feeling betrayed and confused as to how God could allow this hideous being to be blessed with such an amazing talent, he makes it his personal vendetta to defy God and bury Mozart\\'s career.\\n\\nThe film centers on themes of artistic genius and creativity as well as professional jealousy and uncomprehended talent. The universal theme of man against God is also tackled throughout the three hour runtime. These themes are perfectly explored and balanced with comedic moments scattered throughout, which allow the pacing of the film to move at a pleasant beat. Very seldom do you find such a perfectly balanced biopic that manages to remain comic and tragic at the same time. Some of the success of Amadeus must be attributed to the gorgeous location in which the movie was filmed. Choosing Prague to depict the mid 1700\\'s Vienna was a perfect choice and the stages where the Opera scenes where performed were simply mesmerizing.

There is no need to give the actors silly English European accents if you are going to have them speak in any other language other than the original.

F. Murray Abraham took home the Oscar for best lead actor and he will forever be remembered for his role here as the frustrated and jealous Salieri. The inner conflict he experiences as he easily goes from admiration and bewilderment to hatred and jealousy while listening to each composition is outstanding. Tom Hulce is just as great playing the titular character. Never in a million years would I have cast him in a role like this, but it only added to the underlying theme of looks and talents not always going well together. Hulce\\'s cheerful and giggly demeanor slowly grows on the audience as he is first presented as an irritating figure, but gradually begins to appear more sympathetic, and our initial alliances with Salieri begin to turn while he grows darker. I could go on writing about this amazing film, but I feel no matter what I have to say about it, it\\'s simply going to be another mediocre review of an incredibly masterful film.

            "249 ) ['\"It seemed to me that I was hearing the very voice of God.\" Antonio Salieri\\n\\nAmadeus is an incredible film, both in terms of its place in film history and for me personally. I\\'ll get to its place in history in a minute, but first I\\'ll say that for me this film is kind of a big deal since it introduced me to the world of classical music, a world that\\'s becoming increasingly hard to convey to today\\'s youths. Anyway, this film was my entry point into classical music and I haven\\'t looked back since.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, Amadeus is about Mozart, more or less. It\\'s about Mozart as seen through the eyes of another composer, Antonio Salieri. We see Salieri as an old man in an insane asylum when a priest comes to visit him. Salieri then recounts his life, how he met Mozart, etc. He tells the priest that, through a fortunate turn of events (including his father\\'s death), he was able to travel to Vienna, \\'city of musicians\\'. He was successful there, wanting to create music in service to God. All was well until he met Mozart. Salieri was confronted with a composer who far exceeded his abilities. Salieri believed God was talking through Mozart\\'s music and Salieri realized his own music paled in comparison. This was a shock to Salieri which was only amplified by the fact that Mozart was a \\'sensual\\' man, a lover of sex and wine, etc. Why, Salieri asked himself, had God made this \\'monkey\\' his instrument instead of me? The rest of the film shows Salieri and Mozart conversing and trying to get through their careers and lives, with Salieri desperately trying to conceal not only his passion for Mozart\\'s music, but also his hatred for the man.\\n\\nI could spend several paragraphs swooning over the film\\'s technical achievements (which are vast) and the quality of the acting (which is great), but I\\'d rather discuss something else, something I believe is the key to this film\\'s success. What I find the most intriguing thing about Amadeus is the fact that it was still massively successful (winning 8 Oscars) despite not being historically accurate at all. Granted, not all historical films need to follow the history books to the letter to be successful, but the amount of changes that were made in Amadeus were pretty substantial. You can look up various articles detailing the differences. I\\'ll name one: Mozart\\'s laugh which, as you may recall, was kind of funny or annoying your mileage may vary. As seen in the trivia section on IMDb, \\'there are claims that the laugh was taken from \"references in letters written about him\"\\'. A quote by Robert L. Marshall follows stating there is no historical evidence that Mozart had such a laugh. Its use in the film is purely dramatic, because Salieri sees it as the gods mocking him.\\n\\nSo yeah, the film deviates quite a lot from reality, but I think these deviations and the way Amadeus turned out are precisely the reason why the film was so impactful at the time, as it was for me when I saw it in my early teens. The reason it was so successful (and still is) despite all the historical errors is because in the end it isn\\'t really a biographical film, but a film about the people behind the music. It doesn\\'t merely throw classical music at you and telling you to like it, but it shows Salieri obsessed with the transcendent nature of music and his frustration when he realizes he doesn\\'t have what Mozart has. The film conveys the notion of music being capable of expressing the inexpressible. This is why scenes like Salieri salivating over Mozart\\'s \\'originals\\' have endured the test of time, because it\\'s not just about the music. It\\'s about the people behind it. This is where I think a documentary would have failed. Sure, it would have painted a more historically accurate portrait of Salieri and Mozart, but film is more easily capable of delivering an emotional impact. Instead of merely showing the lives of Salieri and Mozart, the central focus is their (particularly Salier\\'s) obsession with (Mozart\\'s) music. By telling the story through Salieri, we see Mozart through his eyes and we too are baffled and amazed by Mozart\\'s genius. This is what Amadeus does right more than anything: introduce audiences to classical music in a way that captures the imagination. That\\'s what it did for me. Like I said, this was my entry to classical music. In a spur of the moment, I told my parents I was going to compose a requiem like Mozart did. Naturally, I never did. I know little music theory and never seriously composed anything. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but the important thing was that Amadeus made me that excited about classical music. I too wanted to experience the level of excitement and transcendence that Salieri experienced through Mozart\\'s music.\\n\\nThis all reminds me of Leonard Bernstein. He\\'s of course considered to be one of the great conductors, but what I think proves that claim more than anything was his ability to convey his passion to the audience. Just watching him conduct is an experience in and of itself. Again it\\'s not necessarily the music itself that excites, but the people who bring it to life and it\\'s this major achievement of Amadeus that makes it a classic and a must-watch.

But with this, the sets and costumes are so good, you can't take your eyes off the screen. You are suckered into seeing a cast of fine actors, with two underrated actors named F.

There is one scene where Salieri (Abraham) plays a fine composition then gives Mozart (Hulce) to critique. Mozart likes it, but makes it even a better piece in an instant. No matter the viewer, they will find that bit really cool.\\n\\nAmadeus tells the fictional story of talented composer, Antonio Salieri in an insane asylum who claims to have killed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. When they were kids, Salieri always liked Mozart's music and has always been jealous of him. His envy grows the older they get and swears revenge, not knowing Mozart already has a lot on his plate. Salieri attempts to destroy Mozart by any means necessary.\\n\\nIn classic take of jealousy and revenge, Abraham gives a white-knuckling performance as one of the the screen's evilest and craziest villains. Tom Hulce's portrayal as Mozart is comical and haunting, funny one minute and serious the next. Not sure if Mozart really was like this, but Hulce gives one of those few instances where a comical character can be serious and Oscar- worthy.

It is a fictionalization of the later years of Mozart\\'s life, though it does contain many actual happenings from his life.\\n\\nMozart (Tom Hulce) is a musical genius who possesses some juvenile qualities. He is impetuous, immature, naive, given to fanciful behavior. At the same time, he is a gifted musician and a driven composer. His marries a young woman named Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), who proves to be dedicated to her husband.\\n\\nWolfgang lives in the shadow of his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice), who groomed him from an early age for musical success, escorting him throughout Europe where he performed for crowned heads and ecclesiastics. Mozart\\'s devotion and desire for the approval of his father never waivers, even after Leopold\\'s death.\\n\\nThe story of the film is told--primarily in flashback--by Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), another composer in Vienna, a man who both worshipped and despised Mozart. This duality of feeling is the focus of the film. Salieri--more than anyone else--recognizes the genius of Mozart\\'s work, but finds Mozart the man to be a repudiation from God, to whom he had dedicated his life. Mozart\\'s vulgarity offends Salieri, causing him to vow enmity toward God.\\n\\nEverything about this film is superior: the music (naturally), the cinematography, the acting, the writing, the costuming, the makeup, the lighting, etc. The performance of Tom Hulce is brave. Jeffrey Jones, who plays Emperor Joseph II, shows why he may be the most underrated actor in Hollywood. F. Murray Abraham\\'s performance is inspired.\\n\\nIn at least three scenes, Abraham as Salieri describes Mozart\\'s music with an adoration that is palpable, blessing the viewer with a rarefied experience. Through him, we experience the bliss that Mozart\\'s genius permits. Mozart and Salieri have a complex relationship that \"Amadeus\" explores beautifully.

My usual impulse is to refuse to see any film that gets crammed down my throat hundreds of times before it even arrives in theaters, so it can be quite some time before I get around to seeing a movie even if the reviews are generally good. My impression from the numerous trailers for 'Amadeus' was that it was a farcical treatment of a real-life classical composer, starring a man with a stupid grin wearing a fright wig, accompanied by a lot of people in 18th century garb dancing in ballrooms.\\n\\nYep, that's what it was. I finally watched it last night, 30 years after Tom Hulce's ventriloquist-dummy grimace first appeared on my TV screen. It was even the ultra-long director's cut which added about 20 minutes to what would have been a long film in the first place. I finished it, but I'm really not sure why. Obviously they spent a lot of money on it, F. Murray Abraham was good, and naturally the music was good, but I don't think it lived up to the hype and accolades.

Not because I don't like it, not because I can't recognise it as beautiful or brilliant, not out of some sort of inverted snobbery. It's simply that it takes much work for me, like a very alien language. I don't have the time or energy for another language in my life, so I leave well alone.\\n\\nAs proof that this is the case, not dislike or ignorance or whatever else people have opined to me as the reason, I offer consistently one of my favourite films. Amadeus was released in 1984, the year of my eleventh birthday. I can't recall when I first saw the film - I suspect about 3 years later on its television premiere - but it made a huge impact on me. In the year of forty-first birthday that impact hasn't diminished.\\n\\nIt's directed by Milos Forman (most famous for One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and adapted by the great Peter Shaffer from his own stage play. It tells the story of Mozart's professional life through the lens of court composer Antonio Salieri, a man tormented by his own relative mediocrity. It opens with an elderly Salieri in some kind institution for the mentally ill, claiming he killed Mozart and unburdening himself to a priest. Through that relationship, with the priest claiming to offer God's forgiveness, Salieri confesses his awe, jealousy and manipulation of the young genius, ultimately playing a key role in driving him to an early, overworked death.\\n\\nIt's majestic, moving and utterly beautiful. It's a study of guilt - who doesn't reach Salieri's age without secrets they need absolution from? It's a study in the corrosive powers of success - the film's Mozart is perhaps most akin to a modern day elite sportsman, feted with praise and money he doesn't have the maturity to handle. It's a study in marriage under pressure - Constanze, Mozart's wife, is brilliantly played by Elizabeth Berridge; devoted to her husband, but one partner always just out of reach of the other.\\n\\nMost of all, it's a study in creativity and what we who benefit from the creativity want the creators to be like. Mozart should be as sublimely beautiful, dignified and upright as his creations. Instead, as this film and Tom Hulce's performance renders him, he's an obnoxious brat with an annoying laugh, no discipline and no self-control. It's that laugh that divides viewers; it's that laugh that Salieri hears even before he first lays eyes on the man he discovers to be Mozart. How can this man create such beauty? Thereby hangs the crux of the film, and Salirei's existential torment. It drives deals he strikes with himself and with God; it defies belief and offends the ears as much the music entrances them. It reaches its height in a spellbinding, unforgettable scene where Salieiri helps a bed-ridden Mozart work on his Requiem (a piece commissioned by a shadowy figure Mozart doesn't realise to be Salieri himself). Mozart hears the music in his head and dictates it to Salieri, who even then can barely keep up. Even with his nemesis at death's door, he can't hope to match him.\\n\\nBased in truth as it is (though how true it actually is, I don't know), the film achieves a kind of truth much more true than mere facts, uncovering the deeper realities of limited humanity's quest for transcendence. That's why, for instance, the American accents the actors keep throughout the film don't bother me one jot. The film is so true that the accents are frankly irrelevant; I'm not distracted by them, which I most certainly would have been by bad European accent imitations.\\n\\nIt's a film which teaches me about beauty, hope, work, creativity and the freedom to take all my prayers - not just the safe, nice ones - to God and leave theme there. In my life as I live it, it's unmatched, unique and irreplaceable. I can't imagine my life without it; and I don't own a single note of Mozart's music. \", '10']\n",

The film opens with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in an asylum after attempting suicide, asking for forgiveness for murdering Mozart (Tom Hulce) in 1791. His story; his confession; this film, is told to a priest by the name of Father Vogler (Richard Frank). \"Amadeus\" takes place primarily in Vienna, from 1781 until 1791, when Mozart dies. Through Salieri\\'s words, we are able to see Mozart as he is (supposedly) when away from public eye, and the picture is less than ideal. Mozart, although still an undeniable genius and musical prodigy, is also immature, rude, selfish, and has no respect for his wife, children, family, nor anyone else in society.\\n\\nIt goes without saying that the accompanying music is phenomenal.

Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce\\'s attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat.\\n\\nMozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.\\n\\nThere are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri\\'s torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.\\n\\nThe staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart\\'s music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of \"The marriage of Figaro\" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn\\'t they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart\\'s genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart\\'s Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from \"The Magic Flute\" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.\\n\\nThe production is lavish and a delight to watch.

            "282 ) [' Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means \"Loved by God\" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn\\'t loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music. ', '8']\n",

The beginning started off fine, it was an interesting, memorable opening scene however it went downhill from there! First of all this film shouldn't be named Amadeus after Mozart it should be named after Antonio as the film is all about him! We are introduced to Mozart about 20 minutes, they cast a rubbish American actor, they should have trained him to do a German / Austrian accent, that would have made the film immediately better! Also Mozart acts like an immature retard, maybe he was like that but where is the evidence!?

Most of the story shows last years of Mozarts life, his character, his career, his personal life and his death. The technical part is done well, especially the scenery that makes a visual impression fantastic. Mozart's music is blended into the content of the film and is a great foundation for consistently strong atmosphere. It's a shame that some potentially great scenes were somewhat ruined with very bad camera work although Forman generally did very good job. Besides the historical inaccuracies that pervade the entire film, bad reactions were provoked by the choice of Tom Hulce as Mozart. Tom did great job, he gave his best and probably did all that was asked of him but he's just not suited for the role. Shaffer and Forman vision of Mozart is maybe correct, but it certainly is different from vision of biggest par of the audience. F. Murray Abraham is brilliant in the lead role of Antonio Salieri and was rewarded for it with Oscar and a Golden Globe. The movie won 8 Oscars and it's shares that number with movies like Gandhi and Gone With the Wind. The screenplay is very good in almost every aspect besides historical inaccuracies. The characters are wonderfully developed, the dialogues are strong and most importantly the story keeps viewers to the screen for the entire 160 minutes. This is one of the titles that absolutely no one should miss, but either before or after viewing, it may be good to read historically accurate story. \", '8']\n",

Ending on a good note is good for a mediocre actor (cue Kristen Stewart, Please!!!) but I felt that Tom Hulce had so much more to give.\\n\\nWith Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) giving us the prologue, the story is based on Salieri's jealousy and envy for Mozart. Mozart (Tom Hulce) is about to compose a piece at a palace in Vienna (Home of the musicians). Whilst eager to meet Mozart, expecting him to be a talented, humble and grateful young man, discovers that he is actually a lewd, immature deviant. After witnessing Mozart perform, then seeing him memorise an entire piece of Salieri's music almost instantly then play it to him, he grows jealous of Mozart as he realises that god has chosen a simple, undeserving boy rather than a devout, dedicated religious musician (himself) to be bestowed with such talent. Salieri then devises a plan to get Mozart to write an absolutely perfect piece of music, his requiem mass, then dispose of Mozart and take the credit for it. He would finally gain his victory over Mozart as he will dispose of him and god as he must now watch Salieri get the recognition he finally deserves. Only time will tell if it will work...\\n\\nThere is absolutely nothing negative to say about this movie. Coming from me, thats a rarity (check out my other reviews, I'm not kidding I always find something negative apart from AC3).

I watched the director\\'s cut which is about 3 hours and to watch a film 3 hours long I had to think a lot before watching. But I must say that it was 3 hours of pure fun. The acting from both the main characters is superb. The story keeps you attached to the film always(mainly because of the acting.).

This ranks as my top musically oriented masterpiece. The symphonies and operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hauntingly decorate the jealous and humorous results of those surrounding the King and his minions in their attempts to corral the young, but gifted, composer. Tom Hulce (as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is absolutely passionate about his perfect music and F. Murray Abrahams\\' Soliere is a genuine gift in expressing many a musicians frustration of never reaching Gods\\' ears with ones works. The idea of mediocrity being a sin is expressed by our anti-hero so well at the end that I always reflect on my own limited musical expressions. Well, there it tis! ', '10']\n",

            "290 ) [\" I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered. Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart. We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy. Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin. He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri. Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak. The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold. In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real. This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement. He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down. He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee. Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy. On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy). The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning. This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away. The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10. \", '8']\n",

After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as \"Pocahontas\") with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While \"Amadeus\" is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart\\'s life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don\\'t just change it to meet your needs--but here in \"Amadeus\", facts just aren\\'t particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It\\'s easy to urinate on his memory today--it\\'s not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he\\'s a musical genius.

The characters have about as much depth as those found in Coen brothers\\' films; the whole Mozart-Salieri is nearly totally fictional; the sordid, soap-operish (no pun intended) relationships between virtually every character are pure Hollywood pap but most importantly (and offensively), there is NO historical basis on which to portray Mozart as an over-sexed, philandering drunkard who took nothing seriously other than his own fame. Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart\\'s notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol\\' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren\\'t so prominent in the film I wouldn\\'t take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn\\'t even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called \"Mozart\", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce\\'s Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.\\n\\nWhat\\'s that sound I hear... oh yes... it\\'s old Wolfgang turning in his grave.

Well, many people do pretend to be connoisseurs of art, but there are a few who can actually find a communion with music. One of them was Antonio Salieri, a decent composer but a brilliant connoisseur of music. To him, as he said it himself, Mozart was \\'the voice of God\\', and Salieri could actually understand the genius\\' thought process behind writing the music. How would this man of extraordinary skills be of character? Would he silent the entire audience with his eloquence and profoundness, outside his music, as a person?\\n\\nIn \\'Amadeus\\', Salieri gets his answer; if the true Mozart were like this, which is highly unlikely, then he would think of these high-brows as \\'dlo trafs!\\'. In fact, Mozart, in Amadeus, is a prodigy in music who never takes anything seriously. Salieri wonders how such a creature could possess such genius; he feels God has purposely avenged Salieri by bestowing upon him average talents while handing Mozart infinite capabilities. As a lunatic in his old age in an asylum, Salieri narrates his life to a priest. In the amusing scene, Salieri plays two of his compositions to the priest and asks them to guess the name of the song, but the priest isn\\'t able to. Then he plays a very familiar tune and the priest immediately recognizes the tunes. Salieri sighs, and slowly tells him that it was \\'not\\' his work, it was Mozart\\'s. It does not come as a surprise here: when I type Mozart in Word document, I get no spell error, but the moment I type Salieri, it is underlined in red!\\n\\nPoor Salieri believes he has killed Mozart, and tells the priest about his lifelong dream to be a great composer and his contempt towards Mozart, the person while reverence towards Mozart\\'s music. Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fiendish, vulgar, lascivious and crude genius who later shows his soft side while Salieri is a passionate, soft-spoken Italian who then becomes two-faced, contemptuous, and monomaniacal and later lunatic. Mozart and his wife struggle to earn money while get fame and respect, while Salieri gets money and fame but struggles to earn talent. For Salieri, it is an internal defeat and hence he tries to bring down Mozart in whichever way possible while wholeheartedly lauding his music.\\n\\nMuch of the film is shown from the viewpoint of Salieri, but then shifts to Mozart\\'s own personal life and hardships. The maid has been thoughtfully kept so that Salieri is able to tell from Mozart\\'s point of view, in case some would be wondering how Salieri knew so much about Mozart\\'s personal life. When Salieri tells about his first experience with Mozart, where the latter is shamelessly caressing his lover under the table in the palace, Mozart plays by telling his lover then wife, Constanze to guess the words spoken by him backwards, then speaks all lewd words. It does feel out-of-place hearing some of the lines here, especially \\'eat my s**t\\' and \\'kiss my a**\\' but nevertheless funny. The scenes with the Count in the palace are absolute bananas, especially to observe the stark contrast between Mozart and the others. Even Salieri\\'s constant plotting is very interesting and enjoyable, especially his most knavish act with Constanze.\\n\\n\\'Amadeus\\', however, fails to provide a thorough justification to its initial build-up. We know how Salieri loved Mozart\\'s music but hated Mozart himself but the moment Salieri\\'s role diminishes and the focus shifts to Mozart, it is difficult to actually sympathize with Salieri\\'s guilt. It is a very common phenomenon, like if we have one actor playing a character for a period of time and then another actor takes his/her place and the audience feels a bit alienated. Also, Tom Hulce gave his Mozart a one-dimensional comic book quality that showed him throughout the 160 minutes of the film as a person of mediocre talents except when playing in those operas in the theater. It is almost impossible to believe that this Mozart was so profound, and \\'Figaro\\' and \\'Requiem\\' were his compositions. I\\'m not saying that an artist has to have that aura always; I have foul-mouthed, alcoholic, erratic friends who are good actors/musicians/composers/businessmen but these people had a certain quality in them that I could associate with their talent. And this erratic Mozart should have had that quality in him throughout the movie which could make me believe that he was the Mozart indeed. And the incongruous accent doesn\\'t help either.\\n\\nSalieri is played beautifully by F. Murray Abraham; his effectively gives his character the shiftiness while advising Mozart and honestly while praising his music. But I found the climactic scene between the two characters to be somewhat underwhelming; I know it was difficult to execute, but it still had to have so many more emotions stirring up in such circumstances. This also wore off the effect of the grand catharsis, which is similar but not as effective as the endings in Stanley Kubrick\\'s \\'Dr. Strangelove\\' or \\'A Clockwork Orange\\'. Much of this I find fault with Tom Hulce\\'s sterile performance.\\n\\nOut of the supporting characters, only Jeffrey Jones truly succeeded in playing his character with the right comedic seriousness. Elizabeth Berridge was competent but inconsistent, her accent not helping much either. The only turkey, according to me, was Simon Callow and the c-word was completely unnecessary in the movie. The music itself was brilliantly performed, all of them. One could see the faults with Salieri\\'s congested arrangements and feel the depth of Mozart\\'s compositions, especially in the requiem for his father.

How on paper it looks so ordinary, but what we see and what we hear doesn't match. First a gentile sound of flute, just a few notes, nothing else, and then violin interferes... But then, suddenly Salieri turns the page. Now it's a whole new piece,the music changed into to a much more vibrant tempo, it's a whole new story now, and with the music changes the atmosphere.\\n\\nAlso, the story's beautiful. The way that Saliery envies Mozart and desires something that he has, how he turned his back on him, how he fought with God for giving Mozart the talent and giving him for reward only the ability to recognize it.\\n\\nThe hardest part for me is when Mozart dies. In the background you can hear his Requiem, La Crimosa at that time. And instead of Salieri's expectations of his funeral- a big cathedral, music playing, many people, we see how he's thrown into a hole with the rest of poor people who didn't have money to afford a decent funeral. It makes you ask yourself: Doesn't he deserve more?

Now where the film kinda struggles is when it comes to it\\'s pacing because the whole 1st act and half of the 2nd act do get a bit slow and although it doesn\\'t completely hurt the film it is still an issue but thankfully the movie picks up from the end of the 2nd half all the way threw the 3rd and personally best act of the movie where it basically turns into a giant war against Blue Aliens and Humans. Many people said that this film isn\\'t quite original and that it mixed Dances with Wolves (1990) with Aliens (1986) and Smurfs and in a way it does in fact mix a lot of different films but that isn\\'t such a big problem if you ask me. What bothers me is the fact that Cameron wants to bring back Sigourney Weaver\\'s character who clearly died and even Lang\\'s character that couldn\\'t even possibly survive those 2 arrows in the chest and even if the film ends with Jake Sully opening his eyes and becoming a full \\'Avatar\\' the movie still doesn\\'t need so many sequels that James Cameron is planning and that is the problem with modern Jim Cameron he is focusing on stuff that don\\'t make sense and especially \\'Avatar\\' that doesn\\'t need any actual sequel and i\\'m concerned that this might be Cameron\\'s first big mistake but i hope that i\\'m wrong. As a romance and as a drama \\'Avatar\\' is definitely 10 times better than \\'Titanic\\' and the same goes for it\\'s action but when you start comparing it with T1 and T2, Aliens, True Lies or even The Abyss the movie just looses it\\'s magic against some of 80\\'s and 90\\'s best films.

He dominated the awards season over a decade earlier with \"Titanic\" already and things looked similar back in 2010 when only \"The Hurt Locker\" managed to keep \"Avatar\" from winning all the very big prizes. Ironically enough, the former was made by Cameron\\'s ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow which made for some interesting references (and bad jokes) at the Oscars back then. But still \"Avatar\" won three trophies at the Oscars alone and many many more during other big awards ceremonies. There are several versions out there of this film when it comes to the runtime and the longest is probably the director\\'s cut that comes incredibly close to the massive 3-hour mark. Your choice if you want to go for this one the original theatrical release for example. You can decide it perhaps if you plan on rewatching this extremely long and extremely blue movie before the sequels come out as it seems Cameron still wants to go through on his plan of releasing no less than four sequels to \"Avatar\" until 2025 that he has worked on in the last decade.\\n\\nThe cast includes Sam Worthington who is the lead actor here and it is definitely the by far biggest work of his career. Add to that Cameron\\'s longtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver and relatively young actors like Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez or Zoe Saldana. The main antagonist is played by Stephen Lang who as usual elevates the material. Oh yeah, CCH Pounder is on board too and deserves the mention for sure. Basically, there are two kinds of people when it comes to \"Avatar\", those who really absolutely love the movie and think it is a revelation and then those who think it is all pretense and nothing special at all. So it sure is a clash of extremes and I personally would say they are both in the wrong. The right approach is somewhere in-between. \"Avatar\" is a movie that is breathtakingly beautiful on many occasions and that offers a solid story that is nothing too great though. But it also offers basically fight and war sequences for 45 minutes or so, basically the entire last third of the movie. And this is where the film somehow lost me to be honest. It is just too long for basically nothing but action scenes, even if lots of important stuff (deaths mostly) happens during that time.\\n\\nAs for the film\\'s frequently discussed environmental message, I am a bit undecided. I think the general concept of showing how humans (or Naavi) should live in peace with nature and all its creatures, plants and animals, is a honorable one, but it is also pretty simple because you could wonder the extent to which the taming, i.e. the violent submission, works against this principle for example. But you could write pages on this subject to be honest, alone about this movie, and at times I must say I think it takes itself more seriously than it should give the substance it has and messages it is sending. I read frequently that people compare this film to \"Pocahontas\", but it\\'s been so long that I have seen the latter (Have I at all?), so I cannot really elaborate on the subject. I think \"Avatar\" offers enough to enjoy the movie as its own creative achievement and even if it has sequences where it drags a bit, it is still very much worth watching, preferably on the big screen. If you have a chance to do so (again), then don\\'t miss out. To everybody who hasn\\'t seen \"Avatar\" yet (if there are actually people out there that fit this description), maybe wait until the new films come out and then I am sure many cinemas will show this original film before and you can watch it there and then decide if you are interested in more. This is (as almost always with Cameron) by no means an actors\\' movie, even if some have baity material. It is really all about the messages and the world and the environment in this movie. All about the visual side basically. A whole new world. Maybe not a whole new movie as there are considerable weaknesses in here without a doubt. One of the better, but not very best films of 2009 I would say, one that deserves neither all the hate nor all the praise it\\'s been getting.

A disabled marine chose to take his dead brother's place on a mission to Pandora, a distant universe. Once there, he finds out about a plot to kill the native people to utilize their resources. The marine, Jack Sully, tries to gain the trust of the Na'vi natives in order to gain information about their people. He then tells this information to the commander to find the Na'vi's weaknesses. Jack soon falls in love with a native princess and learns the Na'vi's ways. He realizes what his mission will do to these people and their lives. Jack decides to help them fight against the humans who have come to their universe. James Cameron, the director, spend over 10 years perfecting the special effects of Avatar using CGI. There are several great examples of this through this film. The best example is when the princess is teaching Jack how to fly the mountain banshees. The CGI created a giant world of floating islands of mountains where the banshees lived. It took almost two years for the banshees alone to be made. I gave this movie such high ratings because of the special effects used throughout the film. The theme of this film is survival. Not only survival of the Na'vi people, but also the survival of nature through the advancement of humanity. The Na'vi people consider nature to be their lifeblood. It is the center of the universe and they have learned to live around nature without destroying it. The threat of the humans destroying their lifeblood is why the Na'vi fight so hard. The colors of this film were incredible. Bright blues, yellow and reds show great emphasis on the theme. These colors were inspired by nature. The forests were inspired by areas of China and Venezuela. Avatar showcases bio luminescence with the plants in the forest. Also, the costumes in Avatar were incredible. All the character's costumes were hand made. This seems like a waste of time on a mostly CGI movie, but every character, including the Na'vi, had costumes made for them. The Na'vi's costumes were individualized to each one, which showed the nature of their people. This film was a great accomplishment within the special effects film. The technology used to make Avatar had not existed before. The team needed to accomplish this was massive and many of them worked to discover new ways of shooting this kind of movie. \", '9']\n",

However, with the film surpassing Titanic as #1 all-time in box office revenues, I figured I would give it a shot, thinking maybe I really was missing out on something special. Unfortunately, the film did much, much worse, as I left the theater wondering how such a shallow movie could now be on top of the heap.\\n\\nThe number one flaw in the film is one that it truly cannot recover from in any other aspect: a terribly shallow plot. If you have seen Pocahontas (white man must learn the ways of the natives) or Dances With Wolves (disgruntled military officer sympathizes with former enemy), you have seen Avatar. There really is nothing else.\\n\\nAdding to that fatal flaw is the high-handed directing of James Cameron. While some great directors (Clint Eastwood immediately comes to mind here) will present an interesting palette of characters and let the viewers decide what they may about them, Cameron instead chooses to be rigid in his character definition. For example, the military is evil, scientists are greedy, and all natives are perfect in their commune with nature. If you have your head in the clouds, then perhaps those kinds of moralist viewpoints will appeal to you. For the rest of us, it is quite sickening. Basically, it turns into 162 minutes of Cameron slapping you across the face with his environmental/naturalist themes.\\n\\nThus, as far as character development is concerned, it practically does not exist. Besides the utterly predictable transformation of the \"one good white man\" and his assimilation into the native culture, no other background is explored on any character. I am fully confident that any decent writer could sit down and, within a day, put together a much more interesting backstory on certain aspects of the film (military, scientists, etc.) that would actually make the conflicts of the film compelling, other than the bleeding-heart sap it turned out to be.\\n\\nPlus, and this is truly the coupe-de-grace of failure, the CGI produces some great images, but unless you are a complete tech-head, it isn\\'t really anything to fawn over. For example, the sinking of the Titanic in Cameron\\'s other big film was just as eye-popping as anything that Avatar put up on the screen.\\n\\nTo be honest, it really makes me shake my head that a movie like this can not only succeed in this country, but do so in record capacity. Have we really become so thoughtless and simple to reduce humanity to such black-and-white constructs? I\\'m sure that the Academy Award voters will have a field day with such themes and turn the ceremony into Cameron\\'s own private ego- massaging, but I for one do not see it that way.

            "329 ) ['James Cameron is a force of nature. Except for George Lucas, and to some extent, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron is, in my mind, the only blockbuster director in the world who brings to his movies an all-encompassing, ambient spirit that is completely his own. A James Cameron movie is simply a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar ups the ante. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a singular vision. Avatar is a truly remarkable accomplishment, the ultimate James Cameron movie.\\n\\nAvatar\\'s ambitious story has Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) traveling to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora\\'s native humanoids, the Na\\'vi. The leader of the Avatar program is Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) are looking to exploit the Na\\'vi and expedite the mining of Pandora for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.\\n\\nJake\\'s inner conflict drives Avatar\\'s story, and it works beautifully... for the most part. Yes, it is a lot like Dances with Wolves in construction. Learning from and becoming part of a new culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. Sully is a paraplegic. His avatar allows him to be free and fully able. It makes sense for him to view the Na\\'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. His relationship with Neytiri, however, is not as successful. The love story has potential. Sully\\'s wide-eyed desire to learn and Neytiri\\'s spirituality could gel, but those traits aren\\'t fully explored. Compare this love story to Cameron\\'s other movie romance, Titanic. There, we could see clearly what both characters thought of the other, and why they needed each other. The love story made sense because of who the characters were. In Avatar, the love story seems to exist as a plot device; to force Sully into changing allegiances.\\n\\nAnother thing keeping the love story down is Neytiri. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn\\'t change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, the CEO practices golf in his office, etc. The point is, these are caricatures. Neytiri is no different, but somehow she comes off as irritating where the others are appealing. Neytiri is a tree-hugging hippie, spewing jumbled \"bio-spiritual\" philosophies at every turn. That\\'s fine, but her spirituality eventually devolves into a lecture on the evils of military conquest and deforestation. It\\'s a little heavy handed. Additionally, I can\\'t get past Zoe Saldana\\'s performance. She plays Neytiri as shrill, pretentious, and bad-tempered rather than bad-ass. She is annoying. The problem is, If I don\\'t find her personality attractive, how can I relate to Sully as he falls in love with her?\\n\\nThe love story doesn\\'t work and the Neytiri character is off-putting, but my problems with Avatar end there. This is a major filmmaking achievement. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what\\'s really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place feel real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na\\'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron\\'s attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.\\n\\nSo too are his technical innovations. The extensive motion capture and CGI used to create Avatar are as convincing as any special effects I have ever seen. The Na\\'vi characters don\\'t give off the slightest hint of CGI sheen. Avatar stands as the very best example of \"performance\" capture. The actors are there. The CG middle man seems nonexistent. The Na\\'vis, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants are nothing short of photo-realistic. All the superlatives in the world can\\'t completely do justice to Weta and the team that brought Cameron\\'s gargantuan vision to reality. Avatar is the gold standard in special effects, period.\\n\\nAvatar\\'s success might be attributed to how Cameron balances the film\\'s many tones. Avatar works as both a science fiction adventure, with some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), and as a classic Hollywood epic. Every type of moviegoer can connect to Avatar in some way, whether it\\'s in the action, the effects, or even the romance. Technically, Avatar represents the height of what big-budget blockbuster filmmaking can be. There is not another movie quite like Avatar. The film overpowers you with its sheer size. Avatar is a massive production; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I\\'ve seen. Like Titanic, it exudes its own unique spirit. Helped by James Horner\\'s beautiful score and Mauro Fiore\\'s epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. As an original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. James Cameron\\'s magnum opus is bad-ass and yet, beautiful -- a truly special experience.\\n\\n94/100 ', '9']\n",

            "330 ) ['Cameron really knows his drama. A tear-jerking love story, the heartfelt downfall at its climax: he applies the rules of drama like few others can. That said this reeks of a routine to go for. Despite such skills deserving high praise its repetition can\\'t be said to be the epitome of greatness. On the contrary: besides these qualities we\\'d like to have some substance. To make things shine is great but a lame standard shining bright is a lame standard still. Nice colours, lots of emotion and baffling CGI: it is almost to be held against a film if all it does is hiding the mediocrity of its plot and its implications (\"its meaning\" that is). That said Avatar may still be the film that uses 3D technology best. That spells genuine innovation and adds to cinema as a whole. That is a method to be repeated and copied - only that this one is the original and hasn\\'t been copied yet. That\\'s truly commendable and a great feat.\\n\\nAnyway: I love philosophy, actual meaning in films and something to think about. Even the best and most innovative use of 3D can\\'t cover all that, can it? So yeah... At this point I see a decent film but no more.\\n\\nThere is a lot more to it though. The setting as such betrays a deep insight into the Zeitgeist, into the hidden desires of present time viewers. It is an ode to technology, to the possibility to shape one\\'s self as well as connecting to others. At the same time the demolition of the old and the bringers of this technology are put in a harsh light. Indeed: we do not trust our own progress. We love it and fear it at the same time. We wish for unlimited possibilities, the transcendence of time, space and body, yet we also wish for stability, harmony and peace. It is impossible to fulfill the conflicting desires of our time. Or is it?\\n\\nAvatar manages to combine the conservative and the progressive and that is not a small feat. Living as an \"Avatar\", like me being Mario in a Video Game, is where it starts. Right into the promises of the past: actually meaningful human relations, breaking things down to the eternally important parts of life, a harmonious tradition. The clash is quite literal: the colonial high-tech army against the natives of a paradise, living in harmony with themselves and their nature.\\n\\nHowever: the Na\\'Vi do not just work as a safe harbour, a bastion against the flood of progress. They also bring a promise we know as new, as a part of progress in our own world. They can \"upload\" their experiences, \"download\" the past and connect to other living beings by \"jacking in\". That is exactly how they \"become one with nature\", how their \"natural\", \"traditional\" lifestyle works. They manage to unite our conflicting desires and truly appeal to something most people do not even see. It is keen insight that looks immensely deep what is required to create this specific instantiation of a superficially glossy fantasy world. It\\'s the \"Internet Indians\", the unity of everything, that many oh-so sophisticated viewers overlook when complaining about the flatness of this eye-candy.\\n\\nAvatar holds a grasp on THE desire of our time. There is substance. Since \"Matrix\" it is customary to have a film claim depth. Where Matrix actually does hold depth, although not behind every Greek name and wisecrack reference, many others did not. Lots of references, likening one\\'s film to insightful classics: people see depth where it is supposed. This one on the other hand appeals to emotions and thankfully never really pretends to be a piece of philosophy. Only that it is. It truly is a milestone.\\n\\nIf I wouldn\\'t detest the plastic perfection, the glossy finish and the flat plot I\\'d rate this even higher. Even so I can\\'t help but acknowledge the mastery this film was done with as well as its creators\\' insights into the big questions of our time. Truly a great film! ', '8']\n",

Titanic\\'s Jim Cameron set out to revolutionize movies with immersive 3-D technology which promised to be unlike anything audiences had ever seen. Since its release, Avatar has drawn enormous crowds; word-of-mouth and repeat viewings have lead, within a mere twenty days, to its claiming the title of 2nd-highest grossing film of all time worldwide.\\n\\nSome conservative groups have blasted what they believe is the film\\'s environmental extremism, with the Vatican\\'s film critic saying that it worships creation instead of the Creator. Others have blasted it for perceived racism, with the \"white savior\" rescuing indigenous peoples. Some have said that the film is anti-military. Most claim, however, that it is simply great entertainment. In my opinion, the truth of all these claims is somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nRegular readers may notice that I almost never divulge any plot information in my reviews. I don\\'t like to read reviews that give away large chunks of narrative; I\\'ve never felt it was the critic\\'s job to tell me the story, and I\\'ll pay you the same courtesy. I will say, first and foremost, that the film is neither the political lightning rod some have made it out to be, nor is it worthy of the hype and box-office its receiving (I can think of many movies that deserve a wider audience). It is, however, constantly entertaining and artistically stunning.\\n\\nEverything you\\'ve heard about the visuals is true. This is not CGI (computer-generated images) for just for the sake of it, nor is the 3D merely a gimmick. Cameron has succeeded in created a completely immersive new world. These are not special effects; this is art. The 3D serves to truly make viewers feel as if they were on a glorious foreign planet, with its own ecosystem and amazing wildlife.\\n\\nLikewise, Cameron knows how to stage action, and the adventure/combat sequences are truly thrilling. The narrative is fine, but not as impressive. The derivative script borrows heavily from Dances With Wolves, Disney\\'s Pocahontas, The Last Samurai, Ferngully: The Last Rainforest, and even Return of the Jedi.\\n\\nThough the heroes are interesting enough, the villains are mostly one-dimensional. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver do fine work, as do several others, but the only truly exceptional acting is by Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) who plays the princess of an alien tribe. Her work, via motion capture, conveys rich, tender, and savage emotion. So skillfully does she portray both the humanity and the strangeness of an imaginary race that the audience connects with her more than any of the human characters. She, and the rest of the alien tribe, are utterly convincing.\\n\\nAs for the controversy, the film does take a strong stance about protecting and conserving the environment. The claim by the Vatican\\'s movie critic, that the film worships creation instead of the Creator, could be valid if it weren\\'t so obviously fantasy. Its theology works in its imagined universe the same as The Force does in Star Wars.\\n\\nI take a more moderate stance than the film does on conservation, as it paints those who mine natural resources as greedy at best and evil at worst. That said, any message about honoring and preserving nature is worthwhile. Also, On a different level, the story can be enjoyed by those who see it as a tale of a group nobly defending their homes, wives, children, and beliefs from those who seek only to conquer.\\n\\nThe claims of racism are, I think, unfounded. Like The Last Samurai, Pocahontas, and Dances With Wolves, Avatar takes a narrow-minded white man, immerses him in a foreign environment, and allows him a change of heart as he comes to appreciate the culture and way of life of his enemy. Unoriginal maybe, but hardly racist.\\n\\nBecause the story and characters are only moderately engaging, Avatar fails to live up to the hype. However, as an action film and a soulful artistic achievement, it is a terrific work that ought not to be missed. ', '7']\n",

When he disagrees with his orders he must choose between his mission and his new-found place among the Na'vi. In the end, he fights for what he believes in, siding with the natives. Avatar was a highly-anticipated film because of the high budget and new techniques used with 3D and CGI. James Cameron used new technology along with new filming techniques hand n hand to develop a new movie experience. He delivered a film with never before used technology allowing for great advancement in the film industry. He was able to see in real time the actors in the digital world and make adjustments accordingly allowing for better motion and action capture within each scene. Lighting Techniques played a major role in giving life and realism to the jungle that is Pandora. Even though Pandora is computer generated Fiore used lighting to breathe life into an animated world illuminating all the qualities of the beautiful nature Pandora has to offer. By creating realistic lighting shining down into the nature surrounding the actors and highlighting the natural beauty around theme Fiore created some of the most vibrant and mesmerizing images of a virtual jungle.\\n\\nThere can be said there are many themes within the film Avatar, but the most prevalent would be the threat of modernization against nature. Another film with a similar theme is Disney's Pocahontas.

John Smith is sent to scope out a native colony for another precious metal gold on behalf of the English empire.\\n\\nThe combination of the 3D and CGI technology, used by Cameron, and the pristine lighting techniques created by Fiore allowed Pandora to come alive in in the minds of the audience.

Of curse I'm talking about the classic Star Trek Movies.\\n\\n4= There is an Alien creature in the movie that kind of looks like of an Alien Xenomorph.\\n\\n5= The Pandora Planet also an African Jungle Amazon feel an look to it. The reason I found that interesting is because that is all I was thinking about while I was watching the movies as to the regards of the sitting in which the movie takes place.\\n\\n6= As I was watching the movie I feel that the over all message of the movie is Cultural Understanding, and Cultural Acceptance more Understanding than Acceptance. Which goes along with my Statement from above. About the movie feeling like an idea for a Classic Star Trek Movie.\\n\\n7= In addition as I was watching the movie I was constantly reminded of the metaphor of the old West in which the people in the West invade and attack the Native Americans but in space. In this case the Humans are the Western Invaders, and the Na'vi are the Native Americans.\\n\\n8= The VO (Voice Over) in the movie is really great, it is told in the format of a Video Diary, and I'm not just talking about Jack the main character telling us what's going in the terms of his mission, but also in the terms of his changing feelings through out the movie and what is he planing what to do. And it's not your typical Video Diary VO either, it's not just VO in the beginning to open the movie and at the same time explain to us the audience what the world of Pandora is. And another VO at the end to close the movie up and at the same time to show what the effects of climax events had on both sides. No it's not like that at all, Jack the main character constantly provides his VO in his POV so it truly becomes a Video Dairy, and not just away for us the audience to know what is going on. And I like that it gives you a sense of feeling that the audience is a character in the movie, and that the main character Jack is constantly reporting back to you the audience in Video Diary format. Like you are an government official back on earth or something. I like movies that have that, it's too bad that not more movies have that.\\n\\n9= Another thing I have noticed while watching the movie is that the main bases for the Na'vi Cutler, is being one with Nature. Now the Na'vi are literally one with Nature, but it got me thinking maybe humans should be with one with Nature. I'm talking MORE than JUST camping and hugging trees, no I'm talking about NOT holding innocent animals captive and NOT shooting innocent animals just for the sport of it. I think the only justly reasons to kill an animal is, A when you are protecting your self, and B when you need you need food while in nature. For me those are the ONLY two justly reasons to kill an animal(s), and the like. So in short I think we should try and take a page from the Na'vi Cutler's book and try and coexist with animals, because if we don't then I would agree with Agent Smith in the first Matrix movie when he said that Humans are nothing but a Diseases Plague a Cancer for this planet. I don't know about you but the very idea bring compered to an Infection is uneasy to me to say the least.\\n\\n10= Any ways back to the cherry stuff, this movie is not only beautiful visually but as for the Emotional aspect that is also beautiful.\\n\\n11= The Soundtrack. Not only it's the one of the best Soundtracks I have heard in any movie, but also the Soundtrack helps you care about the characters and what's going on at that point in time in the movie. But also at one point in the movie I thought the Soundtrack was so good I not only thought to myself that I got to get this Soundtrack, but also some of the music for this movie is so relaxing it puts you in a Meditative State at least it did for me. And on top of all that the Soundtrack for this movie I found that it also helps you get invested in more than just the characters in the movie but it also gets you invested in the movie as a whole, on what is happening at that point in the movie on what is about to happen, etc.\\n\\nCS= Now the movie is not perfect I did have some minor problems in it, such as the Climax fight. And I have to admit at some parts it's really predictable like predicting who the real villain is early on in the movie. And finally I'm not sure this movie really needs a sequel, much less multiple sequels, to me it wraps everything up nicely.

Cameron has always been a filmmaker who brings something new, so of course the hype was really high for his next film. And information of what Avatar was going to be just kept increasing everyone's anticipation for it. This looked like something different. Cameron has long been a favourite filmmaker for me. Terminator 1 & 2 are definitely on my list of best movies ever. So did it live up? Well Avatar is a great movie. It is not an amazing one. The expression style over substance has been used many times and by me before but Avatar is exactly that. Cameron ones again takes the special effects to new heights and also reintroduced 3D to cinema. Technically the visuals are a masterpiece one could say. Also the design and creativity of the world and creatures is great. Not on Star Wars like levels but Avatar looks pretty much flawless. The whole movie has this very epic theme to it. The action is also great as should be expected. It's not as mind-blowing as his Terminator movies or as intense as Aliens or as ridiculously (in an entertaining way) as in True Lies. But Avatar is better than most released at the same time. However, it is underneath this brilliant surface that the flaws are. The story is Avatars weakest part. It totally lacks in originality. It borrows heavily from many different sources. I feel that even if one has not seen a lot of movies Avatar is unfortunately very predictable. You can early sense where the story is going. It is a story that entertains rather than surprises. It is the writing that lacks. Cameron's earlier movies had great dialogue and memorable quotes. Avatar honestly doesn't have those. And then we have the actors. Unfortunately, if I shall be honest Sam Worthington is not a charismatic actor. But it's not all his fault. Cameron can create amazing characters but here they feel thin. None of the actors here are bad but their characters are weakly written. The characters have this predictable feel too them in the same way as the plot. Not bad in any way just nothing more than pretty standard. All this said sounds so negative, the problem is just that I guess my demands on James Cameron are so high.

Its also sort of like the animated film Ferngully the Last Rain-forest, but with more action. It also does have an environmental message that we need to protect all the rain- forests. I think the best scene in this movie was the battle sequence between both the Earthlings and the Na'vi and the hero Jake Sully against the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. I also like the flying sequences in the movie when Jake and Neytiri were flying those bird like creatures all over Pandora. In the end after the great big battle between the humans and Na'vi, most humans were exiled from Pandora back to Earth never to return. Some however were allowed to stay cause they respected Pandora's environment. Jake also became a member of the Na'vi society and all's well that ends well.

Part of that terrible acting is the script. It\\'s so stupid that one would have to be mesmerized by the special effects to not notice it. Let\\'s look at it this way. You have the Ore that floats in the D-bag\\'s office. If the ore floats on it\\'s own, why would the company waste its time drilling when it could just take a floating mountain away? If it wasn\\'t floating because it has no floating properties, why would you not just start with the floating mountains. Seriously, if these masses of rock are just floating in the sky, that would be extremely beneficial for things like flying or movie heavy objects with less friction. There is no reason why the army and company would ignore this area.\\n\\nSecond, why do we give a crap about the blue natives?

The planet of visitation known only as \\'Pandora\\' parallels our world in many ways, the film grips the viewer and asks, \"who\\'s really the alien? Who\\'s really the outsider?\" it shows man as an accursed being to any place he might dare to dwell; \\'Pandora\\'s box\\' reflecting the human temptation of the knowledge of life and death in the world, as stated in the Bible. Illustrating the clash between low consciousness (invasion force) and high consciousness (na\\'vi).\\n\\nThe plot line is simplistic, yet manages to be exemplary. It demonstrates man\\'s often uncanny detachment from the world around him, and predisposition to subduing the earth and making it an extension of his ego, as opposed to something to harmonise with, the saying \"wealth but at what cost?\" comes to mind.\\n\\nThe plot line follows a paraplegic marine, (Sam Worthington) who is forced to fight between this notion of harmony, and the notion of fractal greed, it turns out that his physical inhibition (paraplegia) is surpassed by joining the \\'higher\\' consciousness through leaving his body, perhaps alluding to how spiritualism is our escape from the prison of flesh we inhabit.

At moments that were perhaps intended to move the audience are portrayed weakly while characters with high potential are trivialised by a lack of screen time. As a result, one may question whether it's high budget was worth the outcome. Although the advanced special effects are undeniably admirable and are perhaps what Avatar owes a lot of its success to, the impact of the story upon audiences was minimal, which is where i feel the movie loses most of its magic. It primarily falls to disappointing character development and a predictable plot at the cost of unbelievable graphics, which is unfortunate as it does introduce important political criticisms by highlighting the flaws within American foreign policy.\\n\\nAlthough this film has many credible elements including fantastic CGI and the creation of a seemingly new culture (the Na'vi language and hierarchy), it is let down by cliches and high predictability. For example, the rare material that they seek is named 'unobtainium', a ridiculously uninventive name. Moreover, every character seems to fall into very predictable categories: the cold businessman, the tough military leader, the devoted scientist. Similarly, the storyline and character development were easily foreseeable. Furthermore, the film mentions the network between the roots of the trees a number of times, and the danger that this might have upon the military who are attacking Pandora. However, this concept seems to be dropped and ignored, almost as if the director gave up on the idea. Cameron's inconsistency in the film is further evident by the way the Na'vi managed to speak half in perfect English and then seemed to forget it, why these creatures would have any interest in learning a human language is also debatable.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I believe this film has phenomenal potential, if a more imaginiative storyline was introduced with more complex undertones, characters and inferences it would be treated with far more appreciation. Simply, it is a reasonably good film but fails to fill the shoes it was given. \", '7']\n",

It won\\'t exactly be timeless, though it will be well known for its box office success for a long time to come. Maybe some people get annoyed by the blatant Eco-friendly intent that goes with this movie, but making something that millions of people are going to see pertain to some social issues is not the worst thing in the world.\\n\\nIf you aren\\'t too critical it can be a lot of fun to watch. This mostly applies to those who like action movies, particularly sci-fi action. If you\\'re more of a rom-com or drama type of person, I probably don\\'t need to tell you to steer clear of this. But for action fans, there are not many places you\\'ll find cooler action set pieces than here. Just watching the exotic life of the Navi is worth the ticket price, not to mention their fantastic combative abilities and those of the creatures they interact with. There are very few slow parts, and these are pretty brief and many setup things that payoff later.\\n\\nHowever, there are some deeper concepts to be found if you care to look. Basically, the movie serves as a macrocosm of what has happened throughout human history. A more advanced society wants various things that a weaker one can provide, namely materials, territory, commercial benefits, and scientific research. All of these desires are present throughout Avatar, and we see all of them play tug-of-war with Jake, so to speak.\\n\\nOf course, the social commentary wasn\\'t the only thing that sticks out in this movie. Most noteworthy are the computer graphics and visuals. Not all of the alien species look terribly realistic (mostly those dog types Jake fights his first night in the forest), but all look sharp and clear. It\\'s all very colorful and more than a little weird-looking. This, coupled with the incredible sci-fi action sequences made it an ideal movie to see in theaters.\\n\\nHowever, for visual spectacle to do any good, it has to tell a good story. You could argue that the story is weak. The narrative is coherent and there aren\\'t any plot holes that stick out, but there are some story elements that feel \"cheap\". It\\'s science fiction, which means the writers and story artists can just create some new rule for their universe if they have a story problem. A good example of this is when Jake prays to Eywa to assist the Navi in their fight against the humans, and all of nature is suddenly out in force for the climatic battle. Despite this, the characters are done pretty well. This doesn\\'t mean they will necessarily be appealing, but they all have a well-defined goal, get introduced distinctly, and express what they want Jake to do for them so that we care about what they want. Now, this doesn\\'t mean that each character has a believable or likable personality, because some of them don\\'t. Jake makes a pretty good protagonist; a little generic, but with enough personality and motive and emotion to give him depth and make us root for him.\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t seen this yet, try not to hype yourself up too much about it. The amount of money it made should not sway you into thinking that it is great or even good for that matter, but neither should it cause you to pass it off as garbage. I would recommend renting or borrowing it for free, and trying the first 30 minutes. But if the general look of it turns you away, then don\\'t even bother. Overall Rating: 8.6/10. ', '9']\n",

I mean people were the same when Titanic was released; a lot of people called it overrated but that didn\\'t stop it from winning 11 Oscars and being called a masterpiece by many others. James Cameron has made a lot of great movies in his career like the first two Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, Titanic and Avatar is up there with them.\\n\\nI was blown away by it when I saw it in the cinema.

            "352 ) [\"This really could have been something special. Influential director James Cameron's first film since the mega-hit 'Titanic'. 12 years of waiting, in part so that the technology was advanced enough for the film to be made. The man who gave us Sci-Fi classics like 'The Terminator', 'T2: Judgement Day' and 'Aliens' giving us his most ambitious piece yet. But for all its visual grandeur, its technical marvel, its fine detail, Avatar ends up being a disheartening failure. Why? Because it makes the fatal mistake of completely ignoring the two things that are crucial in any film, story and character.\\n\\nThe film follows paraplegic marine Jake Sully as he takes the place of his deceased brother on the avatar project. Based on the distant planet Pandora, the project involves controlling a body of the natives (known as the Na'vi) in order to gather information about them. Well so far so good, there's at least some creativity. All that disappears quickly. We learn that the military and business tycoons are there to take a valuable material called Unobtainium (oh how do they come up with this stuff). I'm so sick of these lazy plots that have suits taking what isn't there's. We get the message they're hammering us with, leave the indigenous people and their land alone. Of course Jake is persuaded by Colonel Quaritch to deliver information and secrets about the Na'vi directly to him so he can figure out their weakness in exchange for the spinal surgery Jake needs.\\n\\nBut wait a second, something incredible happens. The more time Jake absorbs the Na'vi's culture, the more he grows to love its people and begins to doubt whether or not he can turn on them. Well I've never seen that before. Oh wait, I have in 'Dances with Wolves', 'Pocahontas' and 'The Last Samurai' to name but a few. It is exactly the same story as all of these. It has the same set-up, it follows the same beats, it has the same character motivations, and it even has the same preachy moral lesson. The white man comes to conquer, but the main character can't fight against the culture he initially dislikes but grows to care for. There is not a single moment in the film where I didn't know what was going to happen next. For all the money spent why couldn't they write a better story?\\n\\nThroughout all this Jake develops a relationship with a Na'vi called Neytiri and it is literally there just to serve the plot. These two share absolutely no chemistry. There isn't even a reason for them to like each other. The only reason Neytiri changes her mind is because some kind of sprite lands on him and that's a sign that he has a good heart. Sadly the film is littered with convenient and mystical hogwash like that which is never looked at in any detail. It's fair enough that the film has its own mythology, but at least try to give some meaning. The film suffers badly from lack of explanation. Like why are the military so fixed on destroying the planet to gain the material when it's clear that the Na'vi can be befriended with relative ease? It is basically because we need some villains and those mean humans will do just fine.\\n\\nThe only thing as one-note as the story are the characters. Sam Worthington's agent deserves a medal for getting one of the blandest, most expressionless, cardboard cut-out actors ever to grace the screen to helm a film of this magnitude. It boggles my mind as to how insipid an actor he is. Jake as a character isn't very interesting but there are countless actors who could of at least brought something to the role. Zoe Saldana suffers too, but that's mainly because Neytiri is a totally unlikeable and irritating character. You even have good actors like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang wasted in cliched roles as the plucky scientist and the colonel blinded by stupidity. In a film like this we need characters that are either relatable or interesting in order to keep them from being swamped. You'd think Cameron of all people would know this.\\n\\nWhat I can't discount is just how visually stunning the film is. The world created is something we've seen before, but the detail and vibrancy really is something to behold. This film is gorgeous. The textures, the colour scheme, the shades of light, the environment of Pandora, it all looks pretty incredible and I can see why it took so long to craft. The CGI both stands out on its own and blends with the live-action seamlessly. The Na'vi's design is a bit conventional, but again the detail gone into creating them is there for all to see. The visuals truly are the films only outstanding feature. The same can't be said of the action sequences even though they're are decently staged and can get suitably intense, they're nowhere near as imaginative or gripping as they could have been. That's partly because you don't care who lives or dies.\\n\\nJames Cameron did something here that I struggle to understand. He made a film with such creative potential and possibilities safe. Something that is a boring and hollow experience. Something that is so reliant on its visual brilliance that without it there is nothing to offer. How could someone as talented as Cameron create a story that is so cliche riddled and unengaging? In many ways the film's success is disappointing. It's telling filmmakers that we want more films where the stories and characters can be as basic as possible as long as we get some impressive visuals, where we value style over substance. I want style, but I also want a film that I can be invested in and where I care about what happens. Avatar failed to provide this on any level. \", '3']\n",

Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don\\'t complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation. Unfortunately, some of the dialogue and plot points are terrible, but shut your brain off and it\\'s a fun experience.\\n\\nLet\\'s look at the world of Avatar. It\\'s a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na\\'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.\\n\\nDisregarding the elaborate world-building involved in this film, the movie is filled with cliches, cheesy dialogue, and one-dimensional characters. Let\\'s look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na\\'vi since they\\'re \"savages\" (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver\\'s character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn\\'t consult many co-writers.\\n\\nWhat this movie lacks for in quality of writing, however, it makes up with heart. The ideals the Na\\'vi strive for seem like they have been forgotten in the real world today, and they are what draw us and Sully to them as a community. We cheer for Sully and the Na\\'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?\\n\\nAvatar is good; it cannot be labeled terrible simply because it takes plot points from Dances With Wolves, but it does lack quality based on its disregard for good dialogue and some underdeveloped characters.\\n\\n3.0/4.0 ', '8']\n",

There, he is recruited for an Avatar program, in which his conscious is transferred to a Na'vi's (the locals) body, in order to gain their trust so that humans can harvest a certain metal found on Pandora.\\n\\nNow, the cool thing is to hate on Avatar, but I like it. It definitely isn't the best films out there, but it's certainly not bad. To jump right in, this movie has the best cinematography in cinematic history. This film is absolutely beautiful. The wide shots of Pandora and all of the wildlife sucks you in every time you watch it. The directing is also good, which is expected of James Cameron. The editing is good, which is obvious due to this movie being in production for 12 years.\\n\\nThe biggest negative starts with the acting. However, only in one spot. Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez, and Stephen Lang do amazing in their roles, and make set the tone for the acting. However, the tone is ripped down by the main role, played by Sam Worthington. For anyone who's seen Clash of the Titans or Terminator Salvation, you know that Sam Worthington isn't a good actor. He actually does better in this film that the others mentioned, but he still doesn't do well.\\n\\nAnother nit picky negative is the symbolism for the movie Dances With Wolves. I think that Dances With Wolves is a very good film, and many aspects of this movie come from that of Dances With Wolves. However, nobody can call it a direct copy, just because there are similarities. Another positive is the score. The score for this film is vigorous. Props to James Horner, one of the best movie composers out there, for the score. Some of the scenes where Jake is flying on his Ikran, the pounding score enthralls me every time I watch it. This also leads me to the topic of rewatchability. I've watched this movie plenty of times, and it doesn't really get old. That is a big positive for this film.\\n\\nOverall, I think Avatar is much better than most people say it is.

I loved the original version but personally I think you should watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this extraordinary movie.\\n\\nJames Cameron certainly knew what he was doing when he created this film and put his all into the project. All the performers did great work, with fantastic performances from Sigourney Weaver, Zoey Saldana, Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephan Lang and Giovanni Ribishi.\\n\\nSigourney Weaver, who in my eyes is one of the greatest actresses I\\'ve ever seen - she\\'s definitely in the top ten, perhaps even top five - made Grace Augustine a snarky, feisty and rather rude woman who was hiding a loving, maternal side as well as a great deal of emotional pain, particularly in regards to the destruction of her school. By the way, if you want to fully appreciate Sigourney\\'s performance in this movie, you need to see Grace\\'s discussion with Jake about the school and that is only shown in the special edition.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen Sam Worthington in Clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans, but he was at his finest in Avatar, making Jake Sully into a sarcastic and fierce warrior who also had a childish wonder for the world around him. You also see Jake develop throughout the movie. Initially he seems like a \"dumb grunt\" but grows into a charismatic leader. His love for Neytiri felt very genuine, thanks to the excellent chemistry between Sam and Zoey.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t put Zoey Saldana as high as Sigourney Weaver on my list of most talented actresses, but she still did impressive work as the feisty Neytiri. If I had to criticize her, I\\'d say she was just a little over-the-top when Neytiri found out that Jake was a spy and when she was crying over her father. However to be fair, Neytiri was devastated in both of those scenes and it\\'s perfectly in character for her to lash out when she\\'s angry or distraught, so it was still a great performance. Despite being slightly over-the-top in those two scenes, Zoey proved that she is still capable of subtlety and I\\'m a guy who appreciates subtlety in a performance. For example there was Neytiri\\'s little disapproving glance at Tsu\\'tey when Jake was about to catch his Ikran, her playful smile when Jake deliberately flew too close to her or the vulnerable look in her eyes when Jake acknowledged that Peyral was a good hunter. Regardless of whether Zoey\\'s as good as Sigourney or not, she still made Neytiri my favourite character in the entire movie.\\n\\nGiovanni Ribishi also did a great job by making Parker Selfridge a greedy but conflicted man whose greed was constantly warring with his moral guidelines. He was clearly disturbed by the destruction of the Na\\'vi\\'s home and despite his assertion that they were \"savages\", it\\'s obvious that he didn\\'t really want to go to war with them.\\n\\nThe true villain of this story is without doubt Colonel Miles Quaritch. He was little more than an evil psychopath, who literally drank coffee whilst destroying an entire clan\\'s home. Although not a deep character, Stephan Lang\\'s performance was so strong that the simplicity of Quaritch doesn\\'t really matter to me.\\n\\nI haven\\'t seen many movies starring Michelle Rodriguez - actually I\\'m not sure if I\\'ve seen her in any films outside of Avatar - but she was an excellent choice to play Trudy Chacon. From what I know of her, Michelle is most comfortable in the role of tough and feisty women so she fitted Trudy\\'s character very well.\\n\\nThose six were the greatest performances in the movie but I\\'ll also give credit to CCH Pounder, Wes Studi, Laz Alonso and Joel David Moore; all of them did great jobs. Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald were rather forgettable but to be fair, their roles were too small for us to really see how skilled they are. However out of the two of them, Matt put on a better performance with what he had to work with.\\n\\nThe storyline is rather simple - my younger brother has described it as basically Pocahontas with blue aliens - but that in no way cheapens the experience. Sometimes a simple storyline is the greatest storyline. It depends on how it\\'s told and this story is told extremely well so the predictability of the plot didn\\'t bother me. Furthermore quite a few likable and/or important characters die in this film, showing that Cameron is not afraid to show the brutal reality of war.\\n\\nPandora is a beautiful moon - for those of you thinking it\\'s a planet, believe it or not it\\'s actually a moon despite being close to the size of Earth - and is alive with unique wildlife and plants. James Cameron did an excellent job of creating an entire new world. Aside from the Na\\'vi, my favourite aliens are the Toruk and Ikran.\\n\\nAnother thing to mention is that the special effects are magnificent. Admittedly, I\\'m no expert on special effects but the Na\\'vi, animals and plants all look incredibly realistic. If I\\'m not mistaken, Cameron had ideas for this film about a decade before it came out but waited until technology was more advanced in order to make it as realistic as possible. That was a wise decision and another sign of the passion and dedication he had for this movie.\\n\\nThis movie is probably James Cameron\\'s greatest work since Titanic, perhaps even the greatest in his entire career. He has confirmed a sequel and I hope he puts as much effort into that as he has into this and creates another masterpiece. Only time will tell. ', '10']\n",

The visual details are so well made that even just looking at the screen without knowing the plot, is a treat to the eyes.\\n\\nThe story is set in the year 2154 on a planet called Pandora that is rich with minerals and valuable elements. A private corporation is set to invade this world and try to conquer it, removing the Na'vis from their homeland. I found this to be a good representation of current day political issues, and I think that James Cameron had that in mind as well. The private corporation had big machinery and advanced weaponry, while the Na'vis had to undertake the challenge of fighting them with just bows and arrows. Pandora is home of the Na'vi, an 11 foot tall species with blue skin. The Na'vis have a special connection with their home, one that Grace(Sigourney Weaver)the head scientist, describes as a neurological one. The humans have created their own Na'vis to try and adapt with the culture and ultimately try to persuade them to move to another place without violence.\\n\\nThis is where Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) comes in. After his identical twin brother dies he gets recruited. Because they have identical genes he can connect to his brother's avatar without making a new one; which would be very expensive. This part especially is liberating to Jake since he is a paraplegic, and the avatar gives him the ability to walk.\\n\\nNot only was the CGI and effects spectacular, the story plot was just as good. An example of that is how the characters progress emotionally. The first clip in the movie shows Jake Sully as a somewhat low life guy who picks fights in bars. Jake slowly starts changing his attitude as soon as he knows that his brother died and more importantly after he is introduced to the world of Pandora. We see that he has become more humane and emotionally connected, and less of a military type of rigid person. Of course, we don't see that immediately but rather throughout the movie.\\n\\nCameron did an awesome job making the avatars look like the actual actors, having I think, a very unique touch of details to them, and their own way of conveying emotions that I have never seen using CGI. James Cameron's Avatar changed the whole game of special effects and CGI and probably set a new precedent that other film makers are going to try and achieve.\\n\\nMy favorite scene in the movie is the final battle. I absolutely love that scene. The combination of dragon-like creatures and Direhorses with Na'vi's riding both while battling flying machinery and robots, all give it a sense of out-most epic-ness. James Cameron has definitely set the bar for fictional movies and without a doubt other filmmakers are going to follow his footsteps one way or another.

But as the years passed, the backlash set in ans soon enough, you couldn\\'t throw a stone without hitting someone who didn\\'t like these movies.\\n\\nNot that this isn\\'t also true for a lot of other movies, including Titanic, Little Miss Sunshine, and, more recently, Frozen, all of which are on this list. But all those movies still have sizable fandoms.Not so for American Beauty, a movie you have to look around to find fans of. And certainly not so for Avatar, a movie in which you have to practically be Indiana Jones to find fans of, at least on the internet. For all the technological innovations it brought upon the industry, it is a movie that not a lot of people seem to like. Basically, it is the answer to the question, \"What would LOTR\\'s impact have been on the world if it had been disliked?\" When you say that you like this movie, the first thing that a lot of people say is that, \"But...don\\'t you see that it\\'s just Fern Gully (a movie that I first learned about by these comparisons), Pocahontas (Eh), and Dances With Wolves (a movie I like better than you and did not find that boring even though I watched the four-hour long version). It\\'s not original.\" (Malice is not intended, but feel free to read that in the most whiny voice possible.) Yes, it is like those movies. You fools might think that you\\'re the explorer of your generation by realizing that. But let me break it to you: your beloved Star Wars/LOTR/Indiana Jones/ Whatever is a lot like a number of movies too.\\n\\nAs I said in the ESB Review, there are few big budget adventure movies that are quite like other movies from decades back and books from centuries back and plays from millennia back. There are a certain amount of stories and elements that just stick close to peoples\\' hearts. And so those are repeated again and again. Not that this is a bad thing. I adore LOTR and many other movies that follow this formula. If you want to hate Avatar, fine, I don\\'t care. It\\'s not even my favorite thing with \\'Avatar\\' in its name. But hate it for reasons that are more fully fleshed out than \"It ripped off X and Y.\" By the way, after you read this review, I highly recommend reading Joseph Campbell\\'s\\' Monomyth if you haven\\'t already. It\\'s the definitive work on what I\\'ve just described.\\n\\nSo now that I\\'ve thrown darts at some of the reasons why people hate this movie... I suppose that I should now say why I like it. Here we go. It\\'s not the main character, who is as forgettable as any. The rest of the actors are good and are able to elevate a middling script (people don\\'t watch Cameron movies for the writing, though in this, as in his other movies, it\\'s fine) but they are not great. The top honors go to Zoe Saldana, who takes a rather flat role and infuses it with humor and wit and some majesty.\\n\\nThe music is enough to carry the film at parts. James Horner (who died just this year; RIP) puts together one of his most masterful scores. That statement is impressive considering that this a man who scored more great movies than many people have even watched and who composed the Titanic soundtrack, which sold more copies than any other mostly orchestral soundtrack in history. It feels tribal and majestic yet lively and energetic, and is a good fit for the film as well as a good listen on its own right.\\n\\nBut that\\'s not why I love the movie. I love it because of its world. Some would say that you have to separate the technical accomplishments from those of the film. But as an \\'atmosphere and tone\\' guy, I say that\\'s impossible. That would be like asking someone to go to Costa Rica but only to do activities, not to check out the scenery.\\n\\nSimply preposterous. And the film is impressive sight. I do believe that I\\'ve never seen a live-action film that managed to wow me as much as this one did. Anyone who doesn\\'t think this film looks good doesn\\'t believe that the best CGI is not only supposed to mimic reality, but to fundamentally enhance it. I do. This is also why I love the Hobbit movies more than you, though they are not on this list.\\n\\nNot including this film on this list would be like not including the moon landing on a list of the top 100 moments in the twentieth history. It was such a step forward that to ignore it would be leaving a gaping hole in your layout. And so, while I go back to party under Hometree with the Na\\'vi and give props to whoever made its language, I will end with two final thoughts.\\n\\nOne: this film should have won in the Oscars over The Hurt Locker. That still hurts, even now.\\n\\nTwo: thank you, haters, for moving onto this film and off one my ten favorite films of all time, Titanic. Just sayin\\'. ', '10']\n",

The motion-capture technology and advanced rendering sistem was nearly invented with this film, and is now commonly used in many films.

The cast is led by Sam Worthington, who did a satisfying job in the action scenes but was unable to concede some psychological depth to his character. Much better on that was Liam Neeson, who played Zeus, or even Ralph Fiennes, who gave life to the grudging Hades in a way that makes clear that he was uncomfortable with his character. In fact, I was wondering if any resemblance between this Hades and Lord Voldemort was mere coincidence or whether Fiennes recycled into the mythical character the voice and manners of the villain of the Harry Potter franchise. But this can even be forgiven when we observe the performance of Gemma Arterton, unable to move a muscle of the face. Her character looks like a dead doll.\\n\\nI think the actors are not to blame. Its the fault of Louis Leterrier, who decided to make a film that is visually incredible but without any emotion, feeling or depth.

His biological mother was killed by her human husband, but not before giving birth to Perseus. Questing across the lands in a bid to find the means to defeat the kracken, Perseus frequently is offered help from his heavenly parent, yet refuses his pity. He much prefers justice and care for his fellow humans, and would rather die among them than live forever in heaven. Throughout his quest, battling many nightmarish creatures, he barely scrapes through, yet never asks for any help from the gods. His morality was above the gods who created him, and their threats and the massacres they carry out on humans never intimidate him into submitting to them. It is only later in the movie does Zeus soften up, and Perseus admit he loves him, but he never allows himself to mould his own morality around Zeus, or depend on him as a guide. Perseus doesn't even need the threat of hell and reward of mount Olympus, or heaven, to dictate who he his. He sticks to his own morality, and aspires to help his fellow humans, whether the gods approve or not. He is even offered advantages from Zeus, that would rise him above the mortal humans, yet he refuses them. This movie definitely paints freethinking in a positive light. Without needing faith, Perseus remained kind, caring, tough, brave, and well-rounded. He still learned to love the gods, and respect them, but never relied on or allowed them to dictate him. Interesting ideas stemmed from this movie. Gods being reliant on, and friendly with the very demon who punishes defiant humans, and the fact gods need prayers to survive, or they die, are not to be overlooked. Religious and atheistic people should definitely gives this one a watch. \", '7']\n",

It succeeds in taking the story and do something different with it.\\n\\nAll the changes made are interesting, never forced and form a coherent film. (for example the characters of Calibos and Acrisius are now the same person, which helps the story to feel more focused)\\n\\nThe cinematography is great, beautiful landscapes and even dark, or intimate scenes look very good, and the color palette is very earthy, which fits the dusty environment.\\n\\nIf you know Louis Letteier, you know that the action's always very well done, it has all the trademarks you don't wanna have in a modern action film (many close-ups, fast editing, etc.) but Letterier is one of the few directors who know what they are doing and how to use these techniques effectively.\\n\\nThe special effects have aged fairly well, and were pretty good at the time this movie came to the cinema. One complain, from fans of the original, was that the creatures are now made with CGI, even though the original movie had the great effect wizardry of Ray Harryhausen, which is sad, but i always felt like it was very much hommaged in the animation of this movie. Harryhausen's stop-motion-creatures where great because they felt alive, (for example in The Valley of Gwangi is a great shot, where the monster scratches it's nose when it first comes into frame...), this movie does similar things, the creatures feel very alive and have much character.\\n\\nThe actors also do a great job, Sam Worthington is believable as leading man, and his character arc makes him a much more interesting character, than the shining hero we would expect. Liam Neeson as Zeus is a (literal) match made in heaven, and Ralph Fiennes shows, once again, why he is good in playing fantasy villains.\\n\\nOne aspect of this movie which i very much liked since i first saw it, is that even the background soldiers have distinct characters and are very likable, so that you feel for them when thy get killed, in many films, you don't even wink when one of the side characters die.

(It was meant as a wedding gift for the king Polydectes, the brother of Dyctus who took them in after they washed ashore. Polydectes wanted a stallion from every household in his kingdom knowing that Perseus could never attain one, hoping that Perseus would flee in shame and Polydectes could make Perseus's mother his lover, Perseus instead insisting on bringing him the head of Medusa.)\\n\\nAcrisius, though he was a king, was Danae's father, and he was never turned into the hideous monster Calibos, who doesn't even exist in the myth. The Kraken was not part of the myth, it was the monster Cetus.\\n\\nThough Io does,somewhat, accurately relate the story of how Medusa was turned into a Gorgon, Io herself is not in the myth at all and in fact was a priestess that the Goddess Hera turned into a cow and then drove mad by a gadfly.\\n\\nAlthough Athena and Hermes do aid Perseus to an extent, there is very little involvement of the gods at all in the myth.\\n\\nThe part of Andromeda's mother Cassiopeia infuriating the gods who demanded she sacrifice Andromeda was almost correct. Cassiopeia did claim that Andromeda was more beautiful than the Nereids, which infuriated Poseidon, they were the daughters of his friend and another sea-god Nereus, and he demanded Andromeda be sacrificed to Cetus. This was not the reason for Perseus to attempt obtaining the head of Medusa though, see above. This was more or less a coincidence on his way home as he traveled through Aetheopia.\\n\\nHe did not have Pegasus when he traveled to find Medusa either, as Pegasus was the child of Poseidon and Medusa and sprung fully-formed from Medusa's severed neck when Perseus slew her.\\n\\nThere are many more inaccuracies,though these are the most obvious. Some viewers may not care about these, however it is something of importance when a movie is retelling a myth or story that it be accurate.\\n\\nThe other problems with this movie is the wooden performances, Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes just appear to be going through the motions and don't want to be there at all, same for Sam Worthington who appears to only be in it to collect a paycheck.\\n\\nThe special effects are overused and take away from the movie rather than enhance it.

Yes, there\\'s your predictable messiah complex, and yeah, the deaths of most of the characters lack impact, but in terms of the world and such, it\\'s actually pretty interesting (though not much is really done with it). The people of Earth begin shunning the Gods, no longer praying towards them, so Hades comes to Olympus and talks Zeus into chastising the humans. And by chastising, I mean brutally murdering and then giving an ultimatum to those still alive: sacrifice the princess of their region or suffer a tentacle-y death (from the Kraken obviously). So Perseus who had been taken into \"custody\" and a legion of soldiers go off to find the Moirai, or the Fates, and hopefully find a way to kill the Kraken. The city is taken over by civilians who just want to live, while Perseus and his troupe of soldiers go on their mighty adventure.\\n\\nOne big thing I want to criticize from a mythological standpoint is that while Poseidon is portrayed quite well (a psychopathic rapist), Zeus and Hades aren\\'t. Both Zeus and Poseidon had sex with so many creatures before humanity was even a thing, yet Zeus genuinely wants Perseus (his son; a demigod) to survive/not be killed by the Kraken. Dude, Zeus would want to eat Perseus if anything to prevent his own death, which is something he did A LOT in the mythology, because he was paranoid. Hades, as usual in Hollywood fashion, is portrayed as your usual bad guy. And just so everybody who isn\\'t a myth buff knows, Hades wasn\\'t actually a bad guy. He kinda got screwed over and thrown into the Underworld, but he was actually a good guy; his brothers were asses, but I digress. The worst thing he did was kidnap Persephone and force her into marriage, and while it\\'s no defense for what he did, here\\'s why he did it: he didn\\'t know any better. He lived in his father\\'s stomach for years, only to be sent to the Underworld after the war against the Titans where there was no time for love. He kinda was just stuck there and never really learned a good way to romance, so when he saw this beautiful and nice girl, he practically hopped on a chariot, went into the overworld, picked her up and drove her back down with him. He was lonely and again, not an excuse, but that\\'s the reason. And you can tell he was a good guy because he still let her go to the overworld one day every year (which is when spring begins). So he suffers the same fate of Magneto: misused as the token villain.\\n\\nIt gets a 10/10. It\\'s epic. Don\\'t listen to the critics, this is an awesome movie. One of my favorites.

With that it delivers on its monstrous sea titan the Kraken as well as giant scorpions, the winged Pegasus, and the snake haired Gorgon Medusa who can turn her victims to stone at a glance. What makes the original so much better is its passion for character and story. This film misses out on the whole back story regarding Calibos and his curse regarding Andromeda, as well as the bitterness amongst the gods. Director Louis Leterrier subtracts any dramatic impact of the original for cheap tie in scenes such as the sword in the forest or the Pegasus horses that just happen to be around. The original used great dramatic payoff to produce these elements. Leterrier had better luck when he made The Incredible Hulk. Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus is a joke. Liam Neeson as Zeus is an even bigger joke showing his perverted authority. Ralph Fiennes as Hades is a laugh. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda just hangs in midair. Watching her take pity on Perseus will make us long for the authority and boldness that Judi Bowker possessed when she performed this role correctly.

            "419 ) [\"I'm one of those people who watched (and therefore loved!) the original 'Clash of the Titans' movies when I was a child back in the eighties. And, as any cynical adult, I was sceptical about a remake of one of my childhood favourites. The result  in my opinion it could have been worse.\\n\\nIn case you never sat through the charming Harry Hamlin version, Clash of the Titans is one of those 'sword and sorcery' epics that's a bit like Lord of the Rings, only with Gods added for good measure. Naturally an 'updated version' needs more than a few people in sandals and plastercine monsters and the remake does just that. There is a fair amount of computer-generated special effects, but they're not the problem. One of the main complaints against the new version is that it was filmed in NON-3D and then converted into 3D in post-production, therefore creating a slightly blurred and grainy effect overall.\\n\\nAnd there are some other problems with the finished product, but many of those are cosmetic. Take the lead actor's (Sam Worthington) hair. It's supposed to be ancient Greece and yet he's the only man without long flowing hair choosing instead for a crewcut. Then of course you have a largely British cast (or at least actors putting on 'British' accents) while Worthington's natural Australian accent does tend to slip through occasionally. And maybe the most petty gripe I can think of is naming the Greek town Worthington's trying to save after a popular British 'catelogue store' it always amused me when they're desperate to save 'Argos.'\\n\\nWhen it comes to the (all important) monsters, some of them are good and some do look a little too CGI-ish. The Kraken looked a bit much like the 'Rancor' from Return of the Jedi for my liking, but it's Medusa who steals the show. She was a tough act to follow after her portrayal in the original and, even though she is now fully CGI, she's actually pretty nasty! For some reason though the director felt the need to add too many lens flares (in my opinion) in all the scenes where the Gods were present in Olympus!\\n\\nBut, despite all its flaws, it's actually not that bad. Yes, those of us who were brought up on the original will always prefer that version, but I imagine that there are plenty of kids (young boys I'm guessing) who will love watching Perseus slay one computer generated monster after the next.

The only improvements are the structure of the film where its narrative was more traditional compared to the original being a series of events, the band of soldiers were better defined and the remake Bubo the owl no more then a cameo.\\n\\nDirector Louis Leterrier came from an action background and he certainly handles action and special effects well enough. The best sequences were when the deformed Calibos (Jason Flemyng) shows up, ripping a man in half and splitting blood (surprisingly violence for a PG-13 film) and the battle with the giant scorpions. Leterrier does know how to stage the sequences, but he did have a tendency to use slo-mo which is his style. He also liked to use overblown CGI sequences, such as when someone throws a coin into the River Styx. Leterrier's eye was also not grand enough for the film he did not success he with the film's setting being more grounded: he is much more suited to modern set stories.\\n\\nClash of the Titans embarks on different tones, sometimes it was very serious, other times felt very campy. There were times when it wanted to serious, almost Lord of the Rings likes with its ideas that the Gods needed humans and their relationship to each other and there are dark moments, such as the death of Perseus' family: but the writing wasn't strong enough to back it up. Added to that there were some really bad moments like the origins of Calibos was so cheesy and overblown with him getting stuck by lightning and lifting an idea from Excalibur. And despite the attempts of a serious tone for the most part the film felt the need to add two comic relief hunter characters who felt like they steps out of The Scorpion King.\\n\\nWhilst the troops had more character then in the original film many of the other characters were unwritten. This is clear with the Gods and Andromeda was barely in the film. Calibos too was much better handled in the original then he was in the remake: it was a waste of Jason Flemyng. Clash of the Titans was also filled with Deus Ex Machinas, such as a race of desert sorcerers known as Djinn who stop and tame the scorpions to the sudden taming of a Pegasus.\\n\\nThe casting was poor. Worthington was given a lot of stick for the role and he was stiff: but he was miscast and the role should have gone to an actor in his early to mid-20s. Many of the other actors like Neeson and Mikkelsen seen to accept their roles for the paycheque and Fiennes was basically playing Lord Voldermort again.\\n\\nClash of the Titans was a disappointment because there was potential: it was a film that was in need of a good re-write and flesh out its ideas and characters. I feel there is a place in for films based on Greek mythology due to the vase source material and filmmakers can go from Lord of the Rings style seriousness to a Pirates of the Caribbean like romp. Sadly Clash of the Titans does not fill that void. \", '4']\n",

I could not believe my eyes when I saw that this movie cost 125 million $ and that it grossed almost 500 million $. It makes me sad that such movies earn so much money.\\n\\nFirst of all, I can't believe I'm saying this, but I didn't understand anything from the action scenes of this film. I found it weird that some people could not understand the action in Transformers and its sequels when I had no problem figuring out what was going on. This being stated, the action scenes in this film are very confusing, especially a scene involving giant scorpions. At first there was one scorpion and minutes later, there were about 5 more and I couldn't figure out where the hell did they come from. I blame this on Louis Leterrier, the director of this film. Definitely, the worst part of this film is the directing and I can almost say that it is one of the most poorly-directed films I have ever seen.\\n\\nSecond of all, the script is full of stupid lines and a lot of scenes in the film feel cheesy and worthless. The characters suffered because of this and not once was I actually rooting for Perseus to defeat Hades. And when some characters stood out and I actually got interested in them, they immediately did something which put me off.\\n\\nThe acting of the film is most likely the only good aspect, but not a stand-out. The actors who did a great job were Liam Neeson as Zeus and Ralph Fiennes as Hades. They were awesome, although after thinking of it, Hades' voice was too similar to that of Lord Voldemort, but no biggie. Definitely the two of them worked great when they were on screen together and they possibly represent the only good aspect of this film. Another character I liked, but was barely in the film, is that of Spyros, foster father to Perseus, portrayed by Pete Postlethwaite. Maybe Gemma Arterton as Io and Mads Mikkelsen as Draco are also worth mentioning. Now I don't know if his acting was the worst in the film but it definitely annoyed me the most. I'm talking about Sam Worthington. Can he be more hollow than this?! He is the same character in every film and I can't understand how he gets so many important roles.\\n\\nOverall this film is a 6. I was wondering if I should go higher but after further thinking about this film, it's definitely the correct rating.

I\\'m usually fairly easy going when it comes to popcorn flicks that serve no real purpose except to exist as silly fun. Still, there is a little bit of drawbacks in this film. If you follow real Greek mythology, you will be disappointed. If you follow the original movie, then you will be disappointed, too. This film takes this myth to a new direction, while keeping the basis close to mind. The movie by director Louis Leterrier was still interesting. Surprising a movie that has a title \"Clash of the Titans\" and titans are only once briefly mentioned, that if you say a word, you lose it. Who the hell made the decision of placing an monster named Kraken in the Ancient Greece? Isn\\'t that Norse mythology? Then you got Djinns in this? Isn\\'t that Arabic mythology? The biggest change from the original 1983 movie and this was the love story between the hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) and the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). They change it, to love between the hero and the immortal nymph Io (Gemma Arterton). It was rather a better love story than the original in my opinion, but still the princess made more sense since it\\'s in the Greek mythology, and Io wasn\\'t in this story. Anyways, Perseus is a demi-God who must rescue the princess from a sea monster sent by the Gods. By doing this, he has to kill the Gorgon monster known as Medusa who can turn any onlookers into stone and use her head as a weapon. All in all, this movie was just another visual CGI feast. The CGI is breath taking, but the way they conversion the film 2D to 3D made the movie look horrible. There are blurry scenes, and examples of with people\\'s hair flowing beyond their heads without anything holding it. The hero is hardly likable as he doesn\\'t talk much, the two hunters really served no role and kind of left the group before they did anything useful, the Medusa battle killed nearly everyone within minutes, including all the soldiers I actually cared about. The only actual scene I enjoyed was the Medusa fight, the combination of stealth, fighting an enemy you can\\'t see, and arrows was pretty cool. But what on Earth were they trying to make Medusa look beautiful? The original 1983\\'s Medusa was scary. This one makes her look like a super model with snakes on her. With all the hype behind the Kraken, you\\'d think it would be an epic battle but it only in screen time for a short period of time. Way disappointing. I got confused, I thought it was the Cloverfield monster or a Rancor from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. I have to say the flute scene was a bit funny. Who knew bitch was a word in ancient time as well. About the acting. It was mediocre. Sam Worthington plays the exact same character he played in every other film he has been in. Gemma Arterton\\'s performance was boring and emotionless as usual and even though Liam Neeson tried his best to fit in with the role as Zeus, his talent was utterly wasted. Ralphs Fiennes does his Voldemort voice for Hades which was kinda annoying. Overall: Effects looked pretty but the story was half assed and character development was non-existent.

So with that in mind it didn't seem such a bad idea to remake it with all the current advancements in special effects to hand. Then there is a pretty great roll call of actors filing in to star in it, while for fans of 3D that was also an option to potentially savour. How come, then? It ended up such a big dull dud?\\n\\nThe blame for that falls at the door of the writers, who come up with an unadventurous story. Film's trajectory basically sees Worthington and his band of grumpy men set off to kill The Kraken, where they of course stop off a couple of times to slay some hellish nasties. It's all very muscular with slice and dice and shouting, but the trouble is is that this band of not very merry man just don't look or act the part, especially Worthington, who still looks like the grunt from Avatar. While dangling hair extensions on and applying make-up to the others doesn't make them underworld warriors, it's still Cunningham with a weird accent - Neeson in spangly costume - Flemyng being Flemyng - and Nicholas Hoult being in the wrong movie.\\n\\nThe effects work is very hit and miss. Giant scorpions score well and provide one of the high action points, even if you will struggle to see who is actually being killed in the ensuing melee and the winged horse segments are beautifully done. But on the flip-side is the awful Medussa footage (Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova donning the snake wig) and the 3D moments just feel like tagged on gimmicks (oh wait, they are). Dialogue is often served with a helping of Brie, and come the finale you will wonder what exactly was the mission about in the first place? In fact was it ever made clear? I'm not sure, such was the waft of tepidness that cloaked my brain.\\n\\nIt plays like a video game and is badly written, while costuming never once convinces. Were it not for some fun to be had with Fiennes as Hades and the slice and dice machismo, this would be a total write off and no sequel would follow... 5/10 \", '5']\n",

This is the story of demigod Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, and his quest to fight as a man, for man against the vengeful Gods of Olympus who are royally 'cheesed off' because some soldiers took it upon themselves to knock down a big statue of Zeus Liam Neeson no less. So, fresh from the 'underworld', up pops big bad God Hades (Ralph Fiennes), embracing his inner Voldermort, to teach mankind a lesson. Frankly, why Zeus would ever set a God with blatant mental health issues loose on a species he claims to love is never fleshed out, but then again, this isn't a film that invests much time fleshing much of anything out.

Unfortunately they haven't.. It's a film that isn't as good as the sum of its parts, no wait a minute, that's wrong, even the parts aren't that good. A series of loose encounters that seem under played and under worked leaving you with a feeling that it's all style and no substance. From the moment the rating was unveiled it was clear that they were going to pull all their punches to allow as wider audience as possible to see this mess. A tighter, leaner more adult approach would have benefited this film no end, instead we get superfluous, ridiculous looking characters that come and go without any real purpose. Where is the suspense? Where is the tension? Where are the darker elements the story aspires to? You don't get any of these elements. As an example, they have to kill the infamous mythological creature Medusa and there is no sense of fear or tension. And that counts for practically all the enemies in the film accept, perhaps, the giant scorpions. Anyway, enough is enough, a disappointment, a missed opportunity and not a very good film.

To put it simply this movie pretty much sucks, there is almost nothing special about this movie and almost nothing stands out. The plot is very narrow and simple, sort of like going from point A to point B but there is nothing really imaginative or creative or even entertaining about it. The actor Sam Worthington came out of nowhere and was in \"Terminator Salvation\", \"Avatar\" and now this. And I guess Hollywood is trying to sell him off as the next big thing but he just plays a boring and generic character in everything I saw in him so far, which is few but still. If this was a video game cut-scene it might be somewhat forgivable but it\\'s not. In fact watching the video game \"God of War\" is more entertaining than this. The CGI is alright but nothing all that special and same elements has been done before and can get kinda crappy sometimes for a movie that was released in 2010. The movie is about a half human half god guy named Perseus(Same Worthington) rising up against the gods. Liam Neeson looks the part and fits Zeus very well but his character is easily manipulated. The gods in this movie just seem pretty weak mentally and there powers seem far from being omnipotent. But some parts in the Greek mythology is like this but it gets sort of awkward in a negative way because the gods in this seem too human sometimes. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades who is sort of the opposite of Zeus in some ways. Which is interesting because the last time these two actors played opposites in the same movie was in \"Schindler\\'s List\". One aspect I liked about this movie though personally is how it shows how arrogance can lead to downfall including when it comes to the mortals. I also find it interesting how Luke Evans who plays Apollo in this will play Zeus in \"Immortals\". For marketing reason this film goes 3D as well at last minute and the outcome isn\\'t very good. I haven\\'t seen the original but I have a feeling that it must be better than this. The man build up is for the Kraken and even that was disappointing, it\\'s very short and it\\'s nowhere close to a epic fight.

However, as the time passes the team realizes that there is one way to defeat the monster, but it requires a trip into the deepest parts of the underworld, namely the palace of Medusa, and cutting her head off. As expected, at the end of the journey only a few men survive; just to make the tale look more dramatic. I think I don't have to mention how the whole story ends, as it clearly speaks for itself.\\n\\nActually, from the whole movie the only scene that I was really able to call enjoyable, was the one, where Perseus's entourage had to fight with the nasty Medusa, and one by one got turned into stones.

His work on the original film left such an impression on the world that it can be safe to say that it was one of the greatest old fantasy films ever made, mainly through the creatures Ray portrayed such as Medusa and the Kraken. To me, it was kinda a surprised that it has been remade, so naturally, being a fan of Ray, I checked this action out. Does it live up to the original classic? To me, it basically does.\\n\\nMany elements from the original film are still around such as most of the creatures and the basic story. With remakes, there's always new elements besides updated special effects, namely new characters and the direction the filmmakers went with this one. The new characters are sorta hit and miss, many of them are pretty interesting and sometimes humorous while a few others not so much. One new character whose performance I really enjoyed was Hades, God of the Underworld. He's so creepy, complex, and awesome that while humanity mocks the gods, he puts them in their place. Nice! Sam Worthington's portrayal of Persius is nicely done as he does as much as he can without much help to prove that he's more man than god, though this somewhat stubborn outlook does backfire on him a little, making things a little more interesting. Plus, Liam Neeson makes a great Zeus.\\n\\nNow for the creatures, which are a big part of the story. I like how they made Pegasus black instead of the traditional white, making the flying horse a bit more eye-catching. The scorpions are noticeably bigger and badder than back in the old movie and they have a more prominent role. Medusa is absolutely great as while she has the same basic look as before, her improved design combines both her once great beauty with her serpentine lethality. This makes her both sexy and deadly. The Kraken is by far the most awesome as not only does he look cool, but he is also a terrifying and destructive force of nature, which is enough for the gods to we themselves with fear. The rest of the creatures are good in my book.\\n\\nOther aspects of the movie, like the action scenes and music, are great to behold. There are some things to nitpick like certain characters that are either a little bland or annoying as well as are particular bits of dialog.

I went into it , expecting what I got; pure adrenaline and entertainment. If you go into it looking for precise mythological representation, you may be disappointed, but then aren't most people disappointed when they see a movie after reading the book, - and given the small time period for a movie, why are you ? ;) I knew this going in, I sat there looking for entertainment, as most of us do when we goto the movies, and was most certainly not disappointed. The acting seemed a tad stiff in places as if a given actor was trying to find a reason to be excited about their role, but that's a very small nit, as overall the acting is wonderful, by a stellar cast.\\n\\nThe plot is as you would expect from such a movie, as it does not delve too far into the mythos, yet gives you enough information, along with stunning visuals , to be clearly entertained for the entire 1.5 hours. The Greek mythos adage about gods not feeling loved enough is clear, is simple in its comprehension yet is great content for a action experience. I never felt like I wanted to leave the room, nor did anyone else. I remembered the original quite well, and while in some ways it was better than this remake, what's clear is the attempt to yet again, entertain and in that it achieved that quite well.\\n\\nI do think the snarky comment about the poor metal owl, though honestly semi humorous, was I thought a bit misplaced and in a way slightly ruined the energy the movie had going up to that point. It's not even close to a deal breaker, but having seen the 1981 original at least twice, felt like the owl omission was unfortunate, but I do understand that they were concentrating on other plot points and do not fault them for that per se. The owl, for me at least, gave the movie a distinct feeling of empathy, as I, like I imagine many others, were rooting for the owl, as the stalwart companion. We all love our animal companions after all, which brings us further into a position of empathy as movie goers, yet no matter, as they more than make up for it in other respects.\\n\\nI recommend seeing this if you liked the original, are okay with something unique regarding plot twists, and love special effects as they lend a hand to magical mythological portrayals. \", '7']\n",

However, pretty much the themes and the plot remains the same. The story is really about how humanity has turned its back on the gods and declared war against them, believing that they are now the rightful rulers of the world. This is the theme that runs through the bible, however the difference is that in the bible, it is God who has been wronged, whereas in the film it is a matter of a power struggle between the gods and man, and sympathy tends to lie with men.\\n\\nThe background is (which sort of follows the Greek Myth) that the original rulers were the Titans, who were the parents of the current Greek pantheon. However, the gods, led by Zues, warred against the Titans and defeated them, and Zeus claimed rulership over Olympus. However, Zeus created humanity so that they might worship them, and that their prayers would be the fuel for their power. Hades, one of the three major gods, was tricked into becoming ruler of the underworld, and as such has arisen (in this film at least) as the bad guy. This is not entirely correct, as Hades was lord of the dead, but was not necessarily considered and evil god.\\n\\nThe main part of the movie opens with humanity going about a destroying the statues of the gods, and while they are destroying one particular statue, Perseus and his father are sailing by in their fishing boat. As man is destroying the idols, Hades appears and destroys the lot of them, and Perseus' family is killed in the ensuring melee. Perseus, who is then rescued by the Argives, is taken to Argos where he vows to seek vengeance for his father's death.\\n\\nThe rest of the movie sort of follows the same plot as the earlier version. The gods curse Argos (this is not the Argos that I knew, particularly since I did not believe that it was a port city, I know that there is currently no harbour in Argos, and that it is located at least 5 km from the sea) in that it will be destroyed by the Kraken (the Kraken is not a Greek monster, it is Scandanavian) unless the daughter of the king, Andromeda, is sacrificed (once again, this departs from the myth, as Andromeda was Ethiopian, and Perseus rescued her on his way back from killing Medusa). So, Peresus, and a number of soldiers, go on a quest to get the Medusa's head and kill the Kraken.\\n\\nWhat differs in this film from the original is the Perseus rejects his divine heritage and seeks to do everything under his own power. He is a fisherman, and desires to remain a fisherman, but he is thrust into this world of adventure, against his will. In the original film, his love interest is Andromeda (as is the case in the myth) where as the filmmakers added Io into the mix, who becomes Perseus' love interest. The problem with Io is that she is not apart of this myth. In fact the story of Io is set much earlier than many of the other myths. Io was one of Zeus' lovers, however she was turned into a Heifer to hide her from Hera. However, Hera was not fooled, and set a gadfly to eternally torment her, driving her from place to place. Io was not human either, she was a Neried, a demi-god connected with nature and spring, and it is also suggested that her father was a river god. However, in the film she is a human who was cursed by Zeus to remain forever young because she rejected his advances.\\n\\nUnfortunately, when it comes to a lot of movies like this I tend to be a purist. I have yet to see The Immortals (and am unlikely to do so in the near future, though I am sure to wander into a video shop sooner or later and hire it), and I simply groan whenever I see a movie that has liberally referred to the original source. Granted, not every book can easily be turned into a movie (particularly if we delve into the thoughts and feelings of the characters, which can be very hard to move onto the screen), but when the filmmakers clearly butcher ancient mythology, it does put me off.

Churches rejoice.\\n\\nCLASH OF THE TITANS is written for 16-year-old boys, to be enjoyed exclusively by 16-year-old boys. Hell, I loved the 1981 original film. When I was 16. The 2010 remake obviously has better special effects and much better-realized and refined supernatural creatures, but the acting and the story have not graduated past the level of acceptance required by 16-year-old boys.\\n\\nPerseus (Aussie Sam Worthington, who just can\\'t seem to shake that accent as his ancestors Mel Gibson and Guy Pearce did), a demi-god in ancient Greece, must battle against the gods themselves when the city of Argos is forced to sacrifice its princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos) to the Kraken.\\n\\nLike any story that involves religion, everything happens for irrational reasons and without motivation and without any point. Perseus\\'s very birth is laden with irrational backstory, as mortal King Acrisius (Jason Flemyng) feuds with Olympian god Zeus (Liam Neeson), causing Zeus to rape Acrisius\\'s wife.\\n\\nLet\\'s backtrack for a moment: How exactly do you feud with a god? How does one \"raid Olympus\"? Isn\\'t it on another dimensional plane? And even if Olympus IS just a physical abode resting on the lowest clouds, how do the ancient Greek soldiery (possessing no flying machines) actually ATTACK Olympus?...\\n\\nOnward...\\n\\nAcrisius\\'s wife births Perseus, who is half-god, half-Australian. Acrisius, in a fit of rage, uh, waits nine months until baby Perseus is born, to entomb both baby and mother in a coffin and hurl it into the sea \"to destroy Zeus\\'s seed.\" Guess his \"fit of rage\" didn\\'t take into account it might have been easier to just stab the mother while she was pregnant...\\n\\nLong story short: Perseus lives, becomes a fisherman, in a world which has started to defy the gods who created them. Soldiers destroy a giant Zeus statue and broham Hades, ruler of the underworld, immediately appears as a giant black winged entity (with smaller bat-winged demons reminiscent of JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS) and wipes the floor with the soldiers. So what kind of cretin would continue insulting gods? Yet they do. Queen Cassiopeia of Argos boasts that her daughter Andromeda is more beautiful than the goddess Aphrodite, at which point Hades (Ralph Fiennes, doing his best Gary Oldman), appears again and calls for Andromeda\\'s sacrifice - or he will release the Kraken (which we presume is a Very Bad Thing because he pronounces the name so terribly feyly).\\n\\nAfter Hades lays down his curse, Perseus unwittingly gets roped into the quest to stop the Kraken, which involves visiting Stygian witches, taming a Pegasus flying horse, lopping off the head of the gorgon Medusa and using it to turn the Kraken to stone. While Hans Zimmer\\'s music makes it epic on toast. All in a day\\'s work for a demi-god. But Perseus spends half his skirt-wearing, sword-wielding time bitching about wanting to be a man not a god.\\n\\nPerseus maintains to Zeus, \"We live, we fight and we die for each other - not for you,\" which again, is spoken like a man living in a world WITHOUT gods, or in a world with imaginary gods, i.e. ours. If the gods showed themselves and performed magical, physics-bending havoc when you defied them, I\\'m betting you would learn quicksmart how to live, fight and die for them.\\n\\nBlaming director Louis Leterrier and writers Travis Beacham, Phil Hay, Matt Manfredi for these discrepancies would be like blaming Peter Jackson for the illogical happenings in THE LORD OF THE RINGS. The Greek mythology is already written - if the movie writers stuck to every detail and inserted every ulterior motivation of the complex characters, we would need a trilogy of movies. As a movie version of CLASH OF THE TITANS had already been written in 1981 by Beverly Cross, these remake writers simply took that script - and dumbed it down even further.\\n\\nAs illustrated by the box office, no one cares. In modern parlance, \"going Greek\" doesn\\'t involve mythological classicism.\\n\\nThe visualization of the creatures - from Flemyng\\'s Calibos makeup to the ferryman Charon, to Medusa, the Pegasus and the Kraken - is monstrously good, although I will say that Medusa should have been topless. She\\'s a snake-like monster who lives amongst ruins and turns people to stone with her stare; can you really see her adjusting her ornate bra for maximum push-up effect? I\\'m just sayin.\\' Movie makes an infantile decision to paint Hades as a \"villain,\" as if synonymous with the Christian devil, but Hades was not a simple polar opposite to Zeus; Zeus ruled Olympus, Poseidon ruled the oceans and Hades ruled the underworld, which was called either Tartarus, Elysium or Erebus, and was a region ALL human souls passed through, not just \"bad\" ones. And Olympus was NOT the equivalent of Christian heaven, it was the exclusive abode of the gods - NO human was allowed there.\\n\\nWould that any human cast his unworthy gaze on Liam Neeson\\'s fake pirate\\'s beard and absolutely fabulous outfit; gadding about in a shimmering silvery ballroom gown made of chromium wings that is even gayer than his costume as Qui-Gon Jin.\\n\\nThe grandest misnomer of all: the twelve Titans of Ancient Greece were Cronus, Oceanus, Tethys, Mnemosyne, Hyperion, Themis, Thea, Iapetus, Phoebe, Rhea, Coeus and Crius. None of whom appear in the movie. (Though Zeus and Hades are erroneously regarded as Titans by some texts, they are merely offspring of Titans, Cronus and Rhea.)

After all, Perseus and his fellow travelers went to a lot of trouble to put that head in a duffel bag.

I do recall some of the cheesy effects from two decades ago, but that had to do with the available technology. The CGI involved here is pretty skillful, the one that caught my interest the most was the aforesaid Medusa with that slither thing going on. The Kraken sequence was pretty amazing too, but gee, wasn't the monster defeated just a little too easily? Perseus (Sam Worthington) didn't have to do much more than stretch his arm out to make the save for Andromeda (Alexa Davalos).

The CGI blends in with the practical elements very well, and I think my favourite image is the Djinn and his little blue flame.

The cinematography was OK, but the art direction really was top notch. The acting, in a cast overall, the best in a long while. The plot maybe hard for some to follow, since that it's all singed, as an opera. But it's terrific anyways.\\n\\nI was inclined to say that this film is entirely perfect after my first watching, but now i realize that it's not. But yes, the first one hour is perfect. Period. Denying that will be denying the truth. It's the best first hour ever in a film. You can search flaws on it, but you won't simply find. All the story development was fantastic, and the singing just added a poetry indeed to make it perfect.\\n\\nThe second hour is very good, but not perfect. It had far many performances that just didn't worked for me. Still, they were all really well-made 'numbers'?. Anyways, what really drew my attention in that half was the revolutionizers and their fight to free the France, what brings a direct conflict with the government and the police force, which leads the revolutionizers to their *Spoiler* tragic end. This made me dislike totally the french people, since that they were cowards and choose to do nothing and being enslaved than to help a good cause. Bastards.\\n\\nStill in that second hour, i liked a lot the cinematography on the war sequences, it just brought an epic feeling to it, which of course, i found awesome! The score is also truly awesome, it looked like it fits much more the war sequences than the normal ones, though. And in fact, it was used much more in 'normal' situations.\\n\\nAnd now, a big paragraph to talk only about the cast:\\n\\nI just find unbelievable how Hugh Jackman didn't won the Oscars in that year. He absolutely was the best actor, and Daniel Day Lewis wasn't all that jazz in Lincoln. Jackman not only brings life,sorriness and the tiredness required for the role of Jean Valjean, but also does it superbly. Few times i've seen an actor so dedicated to a role. I also liked a lot Eddie Redmaine in this film, i've never seen him before anywhere, but he definitely convinced me in this role of Marius. And i became absolutely speechless about Anne Hathaway; she was just phenomenal in the film, one of the best performances by a woman in a musical since Bj?rk in Dancer in the Dark, though Hathaway definitely did a better job. To be honest, it's one of the greatest performances ever. No jokes. I really doubt Hathaway would ever repeat half of the effort she put on Les Miserables. Of course, Amanda Seyfried was very annoying, one of the most cringing voices in the film, if not the most. But she acted well. All the cast did, including the Tarnadiers infamous hustle couple, being Madame Thernadier interpreted by Helena Bonham Carter and the always hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen interpreting the dirty monsieur Thernadier. Both were always hilarious when they appeared in the film, despite them being despicable and hated persons in the Victor Hugo's book. And their versions are much better made in the film, i say ya!\\n\\nIf you haven't watched this film just yet... you are losing one of the best films made in the past 30 years! 9.8/10 \", '10']\n",

After years of holding it in, I decided to just get it off my chest and be done with it.\\n\\nFirst of all, if you aren't familiar with the story I don't know how on earth you'd be able to keep up and gather anything from the movie. I've read the novel when I was a teen and finding out it's been made into a musical really took me by surprise. This isn't a story that should be translated into a musical, and this is coming from a huge fan of musicals. Granted, I haven't seen the Broadway version, but a fact is a fact: the story is far too complex and goes deep into character development, musicals simply can't portray that much depth. Most musicals are well aware of this, mind you, so their stories are usually straight to the point to allow the viewer to focus on both the story and the music.\\n\\nAnother reason as to why this novel isn't supposed to be a musical is that it's too dark and depressing. We've all had our emo teen angsty days where we wallowed in depressing music, but this is different. Monotonous sad music that goes on for 3 hours will inspire no emotions in you apart from just wanting to get this over with.\\n\\nI've never left a theater before the movie was over, much less when watching a musical, but after two (give or take) hours I just wanted to go out, breathe some fresh air and remind myself that this is the real life not a nightmare. I truly couldn't tell the songs apart as there was just no break from singing, I mean this literally when I say they sang from beginning to end, non-stop.\\n\\nHow did this movie garner so many nominations and awards? The answer is quite simple: the Academy Awards have always favored actors above others and give their awards accordingly, regardless of the movie. This abomination of a movie receiving praise and awards is offensive to musicals, music itself, the novel and Victor Hugo.\\n\\nWhat truly baffles me is neither the critics nor Hollywood, but the audience who are appreciating this movie. It doesn't matter if you like the stars or the visuals, though everything was horrendous, a badly executed movie is just a bad movie, period. Maybe it's a lack of exposure to musicals, maybe it's the need to like whatever's mainstream and blending in with the hive. Regardless of the reason, it's a shame that this movie gets this much attention when so many other movies, infinitely better than this one (albeit not quite a hard task), go unnoticed. \", '1']\n",

I was eight years old i think, and my father told me that i have to see it, and that was all. But then i saw it again, the last year and i thought it was really good. The characterization was excellent and all the set and the special effects was fascinating. The film is partitioned by three parts, so i\\'m going to go part by part. Te first part is about Jean ValJean, who is a prisoner in the old France, and the policeman, whose name is Javert. Javert give the conditional to ValJean, who\\'s going to be constrained by those papers all his life. He know that he can\\'t be free at all with those papers so he decided to broke them and start a new life. Personally i find this part a little bit boring, but i think is necessary to understand the rest of the history so it\\'s okay. In the second part ValJean starts his life as mayor of the town. He is totally different but soon Javert discover that he\\'s the prisoner ho broke his parole, so he starts to seek ValJean to see him again at prison. At the same time ValJean starts to meet more characters of the film, like Fantine, or her daughter Cosette. This part is more interesting than the last, cause you know more characters and the history start to have sense. And in the third part, you know the rest of the characters like Enjorlas, the lead of the revolutionaries; Marius, who\\'s in love with Cosette; Eponine, who\\'s smitten of Marius, or Gavroche, who is a boy who goes to the barricades with the revolutionaries being like an adult boy. In this part you are totally enmeshed in the film and yo feel like you are in the barricades with all this people fighting for the freedom. In conclusion I think this film is full of emotions and all the type of feelings: sadness, happiness, euphoria... and i thin that all the people who like to laugh, or the love, the tragedy or the belligerent conflicts have to see this film.

I also have other film versions of Hugo's masterpiece, but they are not musicals. This film version tops them all. It even helped me understand a few things not obvious in other versions. Anne Hathaway as Fantine is so, so good - her interpretation of 'I Dreamed a Dream' became a classic the second I saw it. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is excellent and very believable. Eddie Redmayne is a very good Marius and seems so sincere - his role became more important to me than in previous versions of plays or films. Russell Crowe as Javert is not that good though. That is not his element it seems; he is not bad, just a bit too ordinary. The Thenardiers are funny, a bit over the edge though, but it helps keeping the movie from being too 'serious'. Surprising role for Helena Bonham Carter, but she is very good. Is was a very nice gesture to have Colm Wilkinson as Bishop of Digne since he played Jean Valjean so often on Broadway and West End versions of the play. True to the original story.

            "509 ) [\" Considering the 2017 Academy Awards are coming up very soon, February 26th to be exact, I thought it was the perfect time to recap exactly why Les Miserables won three of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for in 2013. Winning Best Supporting Actress, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Makeup all hold true when considering this films major strengths. Looking at the amount of singing, how the actors fit their roles, and the overall flow throughout the film are what make this production great. There is no doubt in saying that this film is musically-driven. I was a bit taken aback with the first scene when Russell Crowe, playing Javert, started lecturing Hugh Jackman, taking the role of a slave named Jean Valjean. To my surprise, every word was sung, right from the start! Even though I knew this film was based on a musical, I did not expect the singing to begin so early on, let alone be the very first words said by the actors. The idea that every word is going to be sung is startling at first, yet catchy and becomes expected after a while. In a way I enjoyed that the characters only sang their verses, because when a scene involving a violent reaction where you would expect a lot of yelling came up, their soft tones gave way to calm voices. This is where the excellent use of background music would pick up and add to the suspense or tension of the situation, hence the award for Best Sound Mixing. Once you do get used to the fact that the majority of what you will hear are the exceptionally graceful voices of the actors, the film flows quite nicely, showing exactly why Les Miserables is a great musical production. Speaking of the actors, they made this film ten times more enjoyable to watch due to their impressive performances. Anne Hathaway went beyond what I was expecting for the short, yet extremely important, time she was in the spotlight. Her emotions and body language shown were alarmingly believable. Especially in the most degrading scene where her humanity was violently stripped from her, Anne Hathaway's image was so convincing without her having to say a word. Another lead actor, Hugh Jackman, brought an act that was so natural and modest I was simply satisfied when he was performing. His ability to relate to the other actors on an emotional level, especially when deciding to take in Fantine's child after she passed, was very believable and sincere. The way that all the characters connect and come together in the end really solidifies any wandering thoughts or questions that may arise during the film. The way these actors present themselves in their individual roles and also together as a cast, makes this film flow so easily. Along with the connectedness of the characters, the way the producer continuously brings items and actors back into later scenes shows the importance of certain aspects throughout the film. For instance, the two silver candles that give Hugh Jackman his character early on in the film reappear multiple times, like a sort of motif. Along with this subtle addition in the film, the way each song moves into and out of the next so fluently adds to the overall neat and easy to follow story line. Over the course of many years, the actors also reappear with just enough of a changed appearance that it is hard to notice until they sing. Les Miserables achieves a great sense of flow by incorporating these qualities that give the film its greatness. Overall, Les Miserables is remarkably deserving of the Academy Awards it received in 2013. The film proved to be outstanding due to the musical talent, exceptional actors who played their roles perfectly, and the way the film created a sense of flow. \", '8']\n",

I think for the most part this film was very impressive, it's not without its flaws but found this film to be very much worth the watch. When Tom Hooper won the Oscar for The Kings Speech the only thing that really bothered me about that was the fact that it didn't really put his talents on full display but their front and centre here, all the musical numbers and character direction is perfect, it really did make you believe the dire situation that these characters lived in and it truly proved to me his talent as a director. Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant in this film, not only is his singing voice fantastic but he carried a real burden and shame with him that Jackman perfectly portrayed. Few performances limited performances have impressed as much as Anne Hathaway in this film, her absolute emotional destruction was perfectly conveyed through her performance and created for some truly emotionally tragic scenes. When I hear bad things about Russell Crowes performance all I can do is scratch my head, I thought he was amazing in this film, he was a true antagonist who was not all the different from Valjean and I though Crowe brought true complexity to the character. This film also looks stunning, all the French streets, dirty alleys and poverty ridden areas truly gave out an impression that truly hooked me. But I don't think this film base some issues for one, after the first 20 minutes the film failed to really grip or interest me, it slowed the film down completely and seemed to spend to much time devoted to setting up the final act rather than give a compelling narrative of its own.

Adapted from Victor Hugo\\'s novel and the musical of the same name, Les Miserables, or Les Mis, sings loud and clear with its star-studded cast, all while exploring themes of righteousness, redemption, love, and forgiveness.\\n\\nLes Miserables stars Hugh Jackman, supported by Oscar winners Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne. Set in France, this musical drama begins in 1815 and spans nearly twenty years over the course of its two and a half hour run time. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is released from prison, but is put on parole for the remainder of his life. Because of his criminal record, he struggles to obtain a job, shelter, or good reputation, and decides to make a new start, destroying his parole papers and going into hiding. Eight years later, Valjean has become mayor of a small town and a factory owner, but is shocked to cross paths with his old parole officer, Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). Seeking to live a godly life, Valjean provides care for his former employee (Anne Hathaway) and her daughter (Amanda Seyfried), all while running from his past.\\n\\nLes Miserables is a true form musical; nearly the entire film is sung. While this makes for a unique film experience, muffled lines and the complete lack of spoken dialogue can oftentimes cause confusion regarding plot details. The music takes advantage of the leitmotif technique, giving each character a short \"theme\" that they sing recurringly. Each theme is linked with its character and creates an identifiable musical identity.\\n\\nThe film focuses on character, using their lyrics and leitmotifs to show viewers the thoughts and feelings of each character. The characters were well rounded and developed nicely. Although singing to express emotions is a straightforward way to develop characters, it is incredibly effective at allowing these characters to become relatable. For instance, when a character sings \"I love him,\" audiences immediately know the mood and feelings of that character, and can focus on how that character\\'s actions, expressions, and words relate to that phrase. Jean Valjean, the protagonist, is somewhat of a tragic hero. Although he does not experience a transition from good to evil, he experiences relatable emotions (fear, sadness, love) and tragedies (imprisonment, loss of loved ones, running from the law).\\n\\nThe music is the centerpiece in the film, but it never quite hits the mark. The beautiful accompaniment is often hidden beneath sound effects and vocals, and the singing itself was often breathy and out of tune (although to the actors\\' credit, the music was sung live during filming, not recorded in a sound studio). The sets and costumes were the true showstoppers, elaborate, well- made, and giving the film a realism that it could have never achieved as a stage musical. ? ?The cinematography contained a few unique angles and shot selections that contributed to the musical nature of the film. Oftentimes, the singers stared either directly or indirectly into the camera, as if they were singing to the audience (not unusual on a stage, but an odd choice for a film adaptation). There were also many wide shots and aerial views of Paris, which would normally be an impossibility in a stage performance.\\n\\nAs a whole, the film\\'s acting, score, and set design were exquisite, but the poor singing scattered throughout proved to be a major distraction.? The film (PG-13) requires a mature audience; it contains some suggestive material, but also explores deep themes beyond the grasp of most young viewers.

Victor Hugo is unquestionably a masterful writer to have written such a compelling tale of love, sacrifice, redemption, and revolution.\\n\\nHow much better can it get?\\n\\nWe were supposed to watch this adaptation in class, due to our teacher\\'s absence. However, she did not leave a copy, and instead, opted to have us answer a few questions in our book, and a chart concerning the character traits of Jean Valjean over the years. And yet, it came to me that I was writing about a character I knew nothing about other than what little was spoonfed to us from our English textbook - who exactly was Jean Valjean? Police Inspector Javert? Fantine? What message did the author want to convey upon writing about a common man in 17th century Paris?\\n\\nTo be honest, this is my third attempt in watching this adaptation of Les Miserables (two of which were when I was about a year younger than I am now - and both failed attempts, at that). Aside from my English class, I needed stress relief from other projects.\\n\\nI do not regret picking this up again. And I never will.\\n\\nThis adaptation was such a pleasure to watch as an introduction to one of the greatest works in literature, a literal classic. It succeeds in evoking the emotion needed to fully enjoy Victor Hugo\\'s maelstrom: it succeeds in showing the raw cruelty of those impoverished times. It succeeds in making you grit your teeth because life is so, so unfair, and there are many who suffer because of it.\\n\\nThose who have read the novel have stated that this is the more emotional version, by far, when compared to the 1998 version, because it truly gets the characters\\' intentions across (and apparently, the 1998 version strays from the characters of the source material). If these are the characters in their true forms - then I can ask for nothing more, because these characters took my breath away. Jean Valjean\\'s conflict with the past that continuously haunts him and the man that he has become, Cosette\\'s curiosity and love for her father (and vice versa), Marius\\' devotion to his cause and what he felt for all that he lost because of it, Fantine\\'s living hell, Eponine\\'s unrequited love and selflessness, and Inspector Javert\\'s conflict regarding justice and mercy.\\n\\nI found myself so immersed into the story, because it was one that gradually consumed me in heart and mind. What was this irony, wherein only death would put an end to Jean Valjean\\'s suffering, offering him mercy in times when many else started walking into the light, all the fruit of his efforts to love and to repent and to begin anew? It was clear that he was no longer the man that he used to be, yet he was driven to an end that he did not deserve because people branded him for what he HAD done (and even then, it was to feed his sister\\'s seven children!). I found myself asking what Javert must have asked himself, looking down at the world he would soon part with. (\"Look down, look down,\" the voices sung.) Was justice a truth, or an ideal pursued blindly? Could all things be encompassed by the law? Questioning all he believed, he too, ended his life.\\n\\nIt was all very, very emotional. The bent backs of the slaves, Jean Valjean\\'s turmoil. (\"Who am I?\") Fantine, losing what little she had, reaching out for Cosette as she lay dying, no longer living after being assured that the ONLY thing she lived for was in good hands. Eponine, dying in the arms of the only man she ever loved, asking nothing more than to be glanced at by him. To be his heaven, and his only one.

The changes here from the musical work against the movie\\'s favor because they turn the fantastical into the mundane.\\n\\nSecondly, recording all the songs live on the set is certainly impressive, but as an audience member it felt like it reduced the ability of the songs and the music to convey the emotion of the scene. In a musical, the emotions come from the songs, and when a song is sung in a slobbery whisper the emotions are muted, no matter how well or realistically the actor is crying.\\n\\nThirdly, the on-set recording also constricted the camera\\'s ability to capture wide shots. This created a claustrophobic feeling and for a musical with as grand a story as Les Miserables this was a huge problem. It also made each song look and feel the same, which is a real problem for a musical like this where every line of dialogue is sung. It gets tedious very quickly.\\n\\nFourthly, I don\\'t think Hugh Jackman can sing the part of Jean Valjean. \"Bring Him Home\" kind of falls off the mark from every other version I\\'ve seen. Acting-wise, sure, but this is a musical and I had a hard time buying him. Plus, that new song \"Suddenly\" is a bore and was certainly made and inserted solely for a chance at an Oscar.\\n\\nFifthly, the stage actors, Aaron Tveit as Enjolras and Samantha Barks as Eponine, are terrific.

I was convinced that Peter Jackson had something to do with the movie. Some of the scenes are very drawn out and it really starts to drag after the first half of the movie is over. Certain things could have been cut out of the movie to fix this problem, such as removing the comedic relief scenes, or by removing/shorting some of the less needed music numbers.

From Jean Valjean held captive until he became the father of Cosette is truly heartwarming. Anne Hathaway shone with her beautiful voice as well as Hugh Jackman which is a real shocking, well, for me.

This is one of the most famous novels of Victor Hugo, already adapted to the cinema, theater and also musical theater.

So, more than a film adaptation of a book, this is a film adaptation of a musical play.\\n\\nNo criticisms to make about the script: he convincingly adapts the story, preserving the magic of music. The actors are huge monsters of talent with excellent voices. Jackman gave a pure soul to his character, contrasting with the vocal gravity of Russell Crowe, who gave body to Javert, a man obsessed with the punishment of criminals and disbelieving in their rehabilitation. They\\'re strong characters, played by seasoned actors with a huge presence on scene. The action scenes between them are breathtaking. Anne Hathaway also deserves a special mention, not only by the physical effort she felt to become Fantine (she became extremely thin and almost bald for the role), but mainly by the quality of what she could do. Staying with one of the most dramatic characters in the film, she played some of the most tragic scenes, and singed their saddest song, \"I Dreamed A Dream\".

It\\'s sad, but with a title like Les Miserables, I don\\'t know how one can expect anything else.\\n\\nNow, I have to share my opinion regarding the choices for the production of this movie. I could rant on and on about how a city full of French people sound like their English because an English accent is apparently the default accent for anyone who isn\\'t American. Sure, that\\'s annoying, but I had bigger concerns.\\n\\nI felt that this movie had some serious casting issues. Les Miserables is supposed to be an opera. The people who were cast in this movie are NOT opera singers and didn\\'t show in any way that they were capable of singing in an opera. That isn\\'t to say that the actors and actresses can\\'t sing. I know some of them can, like Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. But they don\\'t have the voices needed to pull this type of singing off.\\n\\nAfter watching this, I decided that I had to see a live production. A few months later, I got my chance. I was blown away by the talent on the stage. But this talent just further emphasized the shortcomings of the actors in the movie. They would have been fine if they were just acting in a regular movie, but they weren\\'t. At times, it was if they were acting while they were singing, such as in \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" It isn\\'t exactly pleasing to the ears when I had to hear Hathaway cry while she sang. I couldn\\'t even understand all of the words at first. Points to her for good acting, though.\\n\\nThe only members of the main cast who sounded as if they had the chops to do this the way it\\'s supposed to be done were Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit. I know Barks played Eponine in the 2010 version of Les Miz. She was phenomenal then and phenomenal in this. The guard at the barricades who spoke to the rebels after Gavroche died also sounded as if he was supposed to be in this movie. Excluding Colm Wilkinson as the bishop (he was the original Valjean on Broadway), the other cast members seemed as if they should have been replaced with lesser- known actors who actually have the range to do this kind of singing.\\n\\nAnyways, I had to get that off my chest. I only gave this movie a 6 because I liked the story, and I\\'ve read about how hard the actors worked on it.

The production, the visuals, the costumes, it was all very good. I loved the ending, and I loved the cameo by Colm Wilkenson at the beginning (who played Valjean in the musical). What I did not like was the singing. Yes, they inserted some great big actors to get interest ... but they can't sing worth anything. They can sing better than I can, but when you watch the concert and then you watch this, the songs feel somewhat ... emptier. I was highly disappointed that the casting decision had been aimed more at big names than actual musical talent. Songs that are supposed to be overwhelmingly powerful have been reduced so much that almost none of the emotion you want to feel can possibly be expressed, due to the lack of both the vocal range and the vocal power of the actors.\\n\\nIt was a good try ....

Tom Hooper\\'s version of LES MISERABLES is my favorite adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel.\\n\\nTom Hooper chose to have the actors sing live while filming other than prerecording the songs for playback (as they usually do in musicals). This was a great choice, leaving the actors freedom to act (or in this case sing) with emotion as they see fit. Anne Hathaway\\'s portrayal of Fantine is phenomenal!

Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen performances are amazing and the roles really suit them. Eddie Redmayne\\'s portray of Marius is great, he really gave emotion to \"Empty Chairs At Empty Tables.\" Samantha Barks is perfectly cast as Eponine, her performance of \"On My Own\" is flawless.\\n\\nI could go on and on about the great performances of the cast, but here are some things that lacked. I felt that Russell Crowe as Javert didn\\'t perform to the level the other actors did. Though his performance with Hugh Jackman in \"The Confrontation\" was great, his performance of \"Stars\" was a bit weak. Amanda Seyfried\\'s portrayal of Cosette was also a bit weak compared to the others. It felt like her singing was drowned out by the other actors in songs like \"Heart Full of Love\" and \"One Day More.\" Both Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried did great in the film, but their singing could have been improved. Also, Eponine and Marius\\' \"A Little Fall of Rain\" is cut too short, it would have been nice had it been a bit longer.

Of course, it would be VERY difficult to put everything Hugo put into his book into a single film... there were so many explanations, pondering, memories, descriptions, social criticism. However, the things they left out... they picked well. Was it really important to learn about Fantine\\'s past, the love she lost in Paris?

It\\'s the greatest theatrical experience I\\'ve ever seen (more than once). I own the London album, the Broadway album, a \"Complete\" album and an album of excerpts. On DVD I have the 10th anniversary production and a documentary called \"Stage by Stage\" (a history of how the show was put on). I know all the words, though I can\\'t sing a note. Hey, I even read the unabridged novel.\\n\\nFirst, the things it did right. The production values are wonderful. It looks great. The sets and costumes are astounding. Some of the casting is spot-on. Helena Bonham-Carter was born to play Madame Thenardier. Crowe was an inspired choice for Javert and Jackman, while not inspired, has done theatrical singing. Losing the \"Act\" structure, the Act-II show-stopper \"On My Own\" is in a better place in the movie.\\n\\nNow, the things that made a hash of.\\n\\n1)\"Les Miserables\" isn\\'t a \"musical\" but a full-blown opera. Therefore, while acting is important, the music must be the driving force. But instead of doing the music first and getting an ultimate flavor of the wonderful score, they decided to experiment and do the singing \"live\" -- that is, while the film was rolling, rather than mouthing to pre-recorded tunes. With the stars singing as they act, actors are guiding the music! Furthermore, it means when they\\'re walking around their voices waver. Try singing and walking! I\\'m all for experimentation in the movies, but to take one of the biggest products ever to hit Broadway, whose music is beloved of millions, and to experiment in a movie of this scope was ridiculous, and it simply didn\\'t work.\\n\\n2) Some of the actors are not really good singers. In the old days, when they knew how to do musical movies, they might take an actor like Gloria Graham in \"Oklahoma\" and have her singing again and again and again and then splice together all the times she accidentally wobbled into tune. Here, some of the singing is simply not worthy of the music.\\n\\n(Spoilers below)\\n\\n3) A few subjective disappointments:\\n\\na) the Thenardiers were meant to be comic relief, a bit of light-heartedness coming in after all the horrors. But the lethargic, dreamlike, nightmarish way \"Master of the House\" is presented hardly raises the spirits (if you want the ultimate in spirit-raising \"Masters\" try Barry James in \"Stage by Stage\" which is included in the \"Les Miserables\" 10th anniversary concert--he\\'s a hoot). Helena does well, but \"Master of the House\" should be raucous and here, it\\'s whispered. I\\'d like to have heard Helena turned loose and shouting like other Madame Thenardiers I\\'ve seen.\\n\\nb) At the end, the Thenardiers are humiliated by being carried bodily out. Well, the Thenardiers should be humiliated . . . but I think they should go out with their heads high, knowing that the world belongs to the likes of the Thenardiers, and their type always do worm to the top of the dungheap. And their singing, being done live, is rotten when they\\'re being carried out. Double whammy.\\n\\n(BIG SPOILER)\\n\\nc) The ending was affecting (yes, I cried, as I always do, even when I see it in concert). But they have too many closeups and they made two absolutely dumb decisions. The first was to lose that great harmony at the end between the ghosts of Fantine and Eponine, which is always beautiful (and what happened to Fantine\\'s hair? Usually, she is restored to her full beauty when she comes back as a ghost.) The second dumb decision was, in the reprise of \"Do You Hear the People Sing\" to show an endless barricade, hung with French flags. Frankly, and this might just be me, I find the idea that Heaven is a kind of barricade absolutely repulsive. Because of this idiotic image (which, admittedly, was beautifully done) I won\\'t even have a copy of this flick in my house. Shame on you! Shame!\\n\\nd) \"One More Day\" (in some versions, \"One Day More\") was the big Act I climax. Losing the Act structure meant they might have feared they couldn\\'t have a climax at that time in the film, so they downplay the whole thing, but I didn\\'t find it at all exciting or moving (and since they were comic relief, would it have been too awful, after some of the imagery presented in \"Master of the House,\" to have the Thenardiers stick their heads up out of a sewer grating like they do on stage, which is always good for a laugh?\\n\\ne) In \"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables,\" when Marius is braying about seeing phantom faces at the windows and phantom shadows on the floor, would it have been too much effort to show the images he\\'s seeing? They do such wonderful things in film. How about swinging the camera around him and in one sweep, seeing his fallen comrades and then in the next sweep, they\\'re gone? Just to get inside Marius\\' head for a moment! Criminy, people, don\\'t movie-makers have any imagination these days? If Heaven can be an endless barricade (if I get there I hope there won\\'t be any more fighting, for God\\'s sake!) they can show a phantom face at a bloody window.\\n\\nAre there more problems with this movie?

I was just coming into the world of musicals and this would be one of the first I properly became invested in. Upon watching the film I found it quite upsetting (which was to be expected, of course), though I'm sure the proper term is uplifting as we do know the outcome of the French Revolution. The acting on Jackman's part was acceptable and carried the film throughout the plot, as well as his impeccable singing which by all measures made him a perfect casting choice. After its release many people criticised Crowe's singing voice however I feel that his portrayal of the morally tormented police inspector far outweighed the sour notes he may have displayed. By far the most enjoyable part of the film was the relationship between Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen's characters, the Thenardiers who lightened the mood on the mostly saddened tone the film expresses. When it comes to criticisms I have for the film I have two main worries, one of which is Amanda Seyfried who (based partly on my views on her due to previous movies) failed, I believe, to match the standard the rest of the ensemble managed to uphold. This, unfortunately, left a rather distressing amount of emotional aspects unexplored. The other concern I hold for the film is its reliance on the singing-on-set technique which, I'm sure, encouraged many of it's viewers to witness. This left the film without any other unique strategies and made it lose heart when the film- making is considered. However, Redmayne, Barks and Tveit shone throughout the piece and pulled the slightly disjointed plot into an amalgamation of emotion, drama and song. \", '7']\n",

With a budget of $61 million, the film would eventually but deservedly win three Academy Awards and three Golden Globes and gross a worldwide total of $441 million plus. To the English-speaking world, the book\\'s title is referred to in its original French, while several alternatives, however, have been used as well, including \\'The Miserable\\', The Wretched\\', \\'The Miserable Ones\\' and \\'The Wretched Poor\\'among others. So does this beautiful and breathtaking blockbuster, a musical feast for the eyes and ears,possibly then remain unsung? Let\\'s take a look.\\n\\nThe film begins in 1815 and continues on to culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, following the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict 24601 or Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and his experience of redemption near the film\\'s end, as he is about to die in a church, questioning his own life\\'s morals and choices. The film also adapts many natures from the novel as well, examining the nature of law and grace, elaborating the history of France, Paris\\' then urban design, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion and exploring the nature of romantic and familial love.\\n\\nSet against the backdrop of 19th-century France, \\'Les Mis\\' opens with Jean Valjean, a Frenchman released on parole after serving nineteen years at Toulan Prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his starving family (originally it was five years but the sentence was elongated due to his running away). Eight years later, he becomes a factory owner and mayor of Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais, adopting Cosette (eventually Amanda Seyfried) from living with the Thenardier twosome (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), an unscrupulous pair of swindling innkeepers, and their daughter Eponine (eventually Samantha Barks). Cosette is the daughter of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of his struggling establishment workers-turned-prostitute, of whom was trying to raise money for her ill child. All the while and for decades now, ValJean is pursued by the ruthless police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe), devoting his entire life to incarcerating ValJean once again in shackles with the chain gang. Nine years later, poverty increases in Paris, and Jean Maximilien Lamarque is the only government official sympathetic towards the poor, thus causing a group of young revolutionary students, known as the Friends of the ABC, to plan a rebellion of the French monarchy. One of them, Marius Pontmercy (Eddie Redmayne) falls for the fair and beautiful Cosette, where, unbeknownst to them singing at her gate together, Eponine watches secretly in the shadows, also yearning for his love in return but realizing it was never meant to be. Once the rebellion commences, this leads up to the climactic and powerful fight for freedom, as all the souls shot down in the battle are reunited and sing triumphantly at the holy barricade on the other side and waving the French tricolor victoriously before the end credits roll.\\n\\n\\'Les Mis\\' is no doubt a magnificent feat for director Tom Hooper, along with cast and crew. The film boasts fifty-one songs in total, as most of the numbers are phenomenal as each note is sung with a longing passion straight from the depths of the human spirit, including: \"I Dreamed a Dream\", \"Suddenly\", \"One Day More\", \"On My Own\", \"Red and Black\" and \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" Every single song was recorded live on set to capture the spontaneity of the performances, and the actors wore ear pieces which fed the sound of a live piano being played off-stage to keep their singing in key. Hugh Jackman even went thirty-six hours without water, causing him to lose water weight in his checks and eyes, allowing him to display the gaut appearance of a prisoner, and Anne Hathaway\\'s performance at audition reportedly blew everyone away, leaving them in tears and eventually winning her an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Originally aiming for a four-hour running time (as compared to the 1934 film) and fifteen minutes of battle sequence, the film was cut to two and a half hours with fifteen minutes of the final film was cut out. \\'Les Mis\\' was the first film in a decade to win an Academy Award nomination since \\'Chicago\\' (2002). Critics had their own say afterwards, leaving a C plus rating as one sites\\' consensus reads: \"Impeccably mounted but occasionally bombastic, Les Miserables largely succeeds thanks to bravura performances from its distinguished cast.\" Danny Cohen\\'s cinematography made a point in \\'The King\\'s Speech\\' showing the awkward relationship between England\\'s Prince Albert \"Bertie\" (Colin Firth) and speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) upon their first meeting, whereas here in \\'Les Mis\\', for some scenes, the camera-work repeats this for no reason, where other times the camera jerks about wildly, allowing many pivotal moments to become lazy and unfocused. Even though the actors are giving there all during their numbers, a handful can really sing while others fall short of those of whom can.\\n\\nMany adaptations of the film had followed throughout the years, including the more highly-praised 1935 film starring Fredric March and Charles Laughton, and the 1998 version starring Liam Neeson. However this newest installment, with its powerful performance and its demanding to be seen on the big screen will ultimately move you in some form due to its powerful impact regarding the inner pangs of squelched dreams, unrequited love and sacrifice exemplified here as a timeless testament to the survival of the human spirit to live on for one day more.

I still prefer the stage version - it has less pretension that this is realistic. As others have said, the CGI in the movie is over-done. The songs and characters don't need over the top design and effects - it's as if the producers felt they had to throw money at each scene and crowd the screen with people and buildings and objects. The Thenardiers' comic Master of the House, for example, was overly elaborate, whereas the lyrics and the couple alone are amusing enough without so many pranks. The casting is uneven. I am not a fan of Hugh Jackman, but he can sing, if not beautifully, and Jean Valjean would have been hard to cast. Anne Hathaway is OK as Fantine but it's a rather pathetic character and not a great stretch for her. Amanda Seyfried is a bit shrill as the older Cosette but again has a bit of a pathetic role. Eddie Redmayne is wonderful as Marius. Not the conventional hunk, but a lovely singer with a good strong screen presence. The other male rebels have those gorgeous rich voices required of all those revolutionary songs. The children playing young Cosette and Gavroche are great. The woman playing the older Eponine has a nice voice and her songs are done well. But she's not convincing in her death scene. Too healthy looking. The technique of the actors singing live is a stroke of genius. Witness brilliant songs like Do You Hear the People Sing or Red and Black and Drink With Me. They're lush and fresh. I had heard that Russell Crowe can't sing but that rumour was wrong. He's not Pavarotti but he acquits himself well in a demanding role as Valjean's nemesis, Javert. The barricade scenes take a while to pick up. They stop and start too much. Les Mis is a hard movie to film, but I felt it could have been done much better. \", '6']\n",

The Movie follows the story of a thief, Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman),who finds redemption after he is left dubious about his ideas of hate and love by an act of kindness. Everything about him changes and he decides to be a man of good for once,while he is being dogged by the police officer, Javert( Russel Crowe), who believes that criminals are always criminals(he claims to have been born in prison but he is not one). The rest of the story is how Jean becomes responsible for Fantine's (Anne Hathaway) death and pledges to raise her daughter while being chased by the justice maniac Javert amidst the dawn of the French revolution. When he finds out that his adopted daughter Cosette (Amanda loop Sayfried) is in love with a young rebel named Marius (Eddie Redmayne), Jean must decide what to do. The whole atmosphere of the French Revolution is really immersive and actually pulls you into feeling the tension that exist between the rich and the poor. Tom Hooper has brought out a perfect looking movie that is truly a spectacle to watch. Here and there a few problems creep up,one which I felt was the length of the film and some of the dialogues(songs I mean) felt a little stretched. Despite these tiny annoyances, this film keeps your attention through it's beautiful visual story telling and terrific performances by its cast. Even when the songs get a little tiring their performances drive it to the finishing line. Some aspects of the movie like the love triangle( sort of ) between Cosette, Marius and Epoine ( Samantha Barks) didn't get the seriousness that it was trying to portray and I felt Epoine lamenting about lost love fell on deaf ears. Also the Thenaedier couple got a bit more screen time than what they needed. But other than that the movie is brilliant to watch.Hugh Jackman , Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway nail it. Especially Anne Hathaway's performance screams for an Oscar. Even little Cosette shines a symbol of innocence and truth amidst the social decay of France.

I\\'m glad they can see past the close ups, misplaced singing, and brushed over side characters because I can\\'t.\\n\\nI tell you all of this because I just believe Les Miserables is just directed in a way where it ether just doesn\\'t look good, confusing, or just boring. However, my complaints aren\\'t connected to the acting in the film. For as much as Russell Crow has been criticized by critics for his horrific singing, he\\'s still Russell Crow. He brings a solid performance of honor, determination, and authority. Hugh still gives his best singing and acting wise. And Ann Hathaway gave her role as Fantine her best. If this was shot in a way that was slow or tense or at the very least normal, this could\\'ve worked. Sort of what Joe Wright did for Pride and Prejudice , just a solid adaptation of classic with enough standout performances to make it an independent piece art but still keeping it to the source material so that you can say \"they made that\". But that\\'s not what they wanted. They wanted an action adventure with dark deaths, harsh outcomes, and ambiguity... with singing! That\\'s the biggest problem with the movie. It\\'s not sure if it wants to be an independent piece of art or faithful to the original musical. So, after a dramatic sequence where someone important dies, you might get some random slapstick that isn\\'t even funny. It also wants to be a dark comedy along with being a dramatic piece of art. This works, if you\\'re given a world you can fully embarrass. In Pulp Fiction, you laugh at horrific scenes because the protagonists didn\\'t know what was truly going to happen. So it felt like you, a person with morals, could understand how insane these people really are. But in Les Miserables, there is no consistency with the kind of world they\\'re living. It just says, \"There needs to be humor now\" or \"there needs to be drama now\". There is no over arcing tone to it all.\\n\\nBut, I\\'ll say it again; the actors really buy into what is going on. They fully devote themselves to these roles. So, is it good? Well, in my opinion, I believe it\\'s weak. I personally hate weak films because I can\\'t particularly hate them nor can I like them.

Although there are some great voices, the majority of the film consists of terrible singers, which feels so out of place with all of the great instrumental.

That said, I decided I didn't like the musical because I simply don't like the plot. I haven't read the original story, I hasten to add -- maybe it was better as literature. But the plot of the musical is hard to buy into. The main characters make a habit of doing things that make no sense.

And his children's children unto the seventh generation.\\n\\nThe plot aspects dealing with the short-lived 1833 revolution really don't work for me.

I give some points to the producers for attempting to get a live feel to the performances. It is a conversion of a stage play, after all. Still, I don't think the effort really works. The camera angles are all wrong, and made me feel cramped and dirty. I don't really want to enter that world viscerally, I guess.\\n\\nMuch has been made of the fact that the performers were basically film actors rather than stage performers. I don't think that's necessarily a disqualifier, but it does create problems. Singing on pitch is only part of the challenge, after all. The singer's art also encompasses feeling and nuance. The skills required to do that on film don't always correspond to what it takes on stage. In any event, the singing just didn't work for me in this version. When you decide to film a production in which every word is sung, that's a problem.\\n\\nThe combination of not really liking the story combined with the flaws in presentation chased me from my seat about an hour in.

In 'Fantine's Arrest', 'Confrontation' and 'Stars', Crowe drags his notes on, removing the power and strictness that a crisper staccato would bring.\\n\\nAnne Hathaway, however, emotes too much. Her acting ability is absolutely amazing as Fantine, portraying her struggles and her desperation brilliantly. However, she extends this too much to her singing, and the result is a boring rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' that is so spluttery it's difficult to listen to.\\n\\nEddie Redmayne and Aaron Tveit as Marius and Enjolras (respectively) lack power and conviction in their voices for the roles of the revolutionaries.

I could spend another five paragraphs singing the praises of Barks. But I\\'ll stop here. I\\'ll definitely be looking out for her in the future.

So here is my review for the film in my heart I knew I would despise.\\n\\nTom Hooper usually makes films that do not peak my interest, they are very much award orientated films and that's just not me.\\n\\nThe film revolves around an ex-convict known Jean Valjean (Jackman) as he tries to reinvent his life after he is convicted with petty theft, now trying to become a very model citizen. No matter how hard he may try, Inspector Javert (Crowe) a very dedicated lawman who will take down his man no matter how well his life has turned around.\\n\\nValjean's life is now better than he probably ever expected, he's now a very wealthy man, mayor of his town and Javert accidentally comes across him, both mean realising who the other is setting up a long and arduous chase by Javert to catch his man. Even if that means decades of chasing and hunting him throughout a student uprising resulting in pretty severe war time.\\n\\nThe film is acted beautifully by the entire cast and I usually shy away from praising an entire cast, however I can't say anybody in this film gave a less than stellar performance. Jackman portrays a very wounded and pain driven man, his best acting performance to date.\\n\\nOverall, I can HIGHLY recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of this kind of film, it may be long but there is no point in which you're thinking about time. However, you will definitely need a toilet break at some point. My favourite performance from the entire film came from unknown Samantha Barks playing Eponin, she was a revelation, hope she goes onto much bigger things. \", '10']\n",

Starting with the cruelty of the people who imprisoned people for some small stuff and yet freeing them as dangerous men leading to their dis- acceptance in the society. Soldiers in that time, as the movie shows, were like machines, bodies that work for the government with not a little pit of conscience. Starting with a thief, Hugh Jackman ended up to be guided to God by a priest.\\n\\nFrom the start the movie compels the audience to watch more. Time later shows how cruel the people were, for instance firing a woman because she had a child with no marriage, even though she begged that she needed money to pay for the people who her child lives with. The thing that started the fight and made the helper of Hugh Jackman to fire her was the jealousy the women had against her, Anne Hathaway.\\n\\nI consider Anne Hathaway to be a brave woman who would cut all her hair for a movie, even though she wasn't obliged to. Other than her hair, she have lost so much weight in order to act in this movie. Very few actors who would do such a thing. Through her scenes, Anne, as her character, showed so much bravery by doing such indecent things to gain a little amount of money.\\n\\nRussel Crowe is a typical example of a machine for the government, he abides to the law with his whole heart. As the revolution started I thought for a second that he went against the government by helping the revolutionists, but at the end he appeared to be as a spy.\\n\\nDaniel's Huttlestone role grabbed my attention, he was a very brave actor.

            "591 ) ['Movie Review of Les Miserables\\n\\nLes Miserables is a drama-filled and emotion packed film that has received a lot of respect since it was released on the 25th of December, 2012 (Hooper 2012). Originally being a musical on Broadway, Tom Hooper, the director, brought it to the big screen. Hooper followed the story line from the Broadway musical pretty tightly and even kept the live musical style to it. Out of the huge number of actors needed to make this film possible, the main and most well known actors were Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe who played the three main characters of Jean Valjean, Fantine, and Javert (\"Les Miserables\"). The actors, the live singing, and the set design had a large impact on the success of this film, but what I believe won Les Miserables its 51 awards was its easily relating to story plot featuring a hurting economy, a country in the middle of war, and the struggle of a prisoner trying to get back on his feet.\\n\\nThe setting for this movie was France in the mid-1800s. The majority of the people in France like in the movie were facing rough economic hardships. There was a lot of poverty and crimes committed because of the economic situation. In the movie, Anne Hathaway played a mother who did everything she could to support her daughter. When Fantine (Hathaway) was fired from her job working in the factory, she had to resort to anything that resulted into her receiving some type of income. Fantine sold her hair and even sold herself into prostitution just to be able to provide for her daughter (\"Les Miserables\"). This scene often reaches out to many parents\\' emotions because just like Fantine, most would do anything just to provide for their family. Maybe a father has to work a third job or a family has to mortgage their house, and although these sacrifices are not as dramatic or extreme as falling into prostitution, the same emotions are shared from the characters in Les Miserables to the audience.\\n\\nThe Revolution trying to overthrow the French government was also displayed in this movie. Like many of us know, with war comes the sacrifices of many lives for the greater good. When I think of war, I do not just think of fighting and blood, I also think of love. With the Revolution in Les Miserables, a large amount of love is shown between characters and their families. Like in society today, many friends or significant others would take a bullet in order to save the person they love just as Eponine, a friend of Marius, did. With Eponine sacrificing her life for a friend, strong emotions are presented to the audience. War veterans and families of war heroes, are immediately connected and engaged in the movie because they can somehow relate themselves to one of the members of the Revolution. Later in the Revolution, all but one student dies leaving the one surviving with despair and devastation. This feeling of despair and devastation is always seen in families and through veterans when lives are lost. Because Hooper was able to engage and connect his audience with those feelings, he was able to make his movie and the meaning of it so much stronger.\\n\\nOne last component Hooper was able to correlate with his audience in order to make the movie successful was the struggles of a convict trying to get back on his feet. According to Fox43, a little over 60 percent of inmates return to prison within three years of being released. Seeing Jean Valjean\\'s experience, the audience is able to correlate the hardships that recently released inmates experience. Just as Javert kept a close watch on Jean Valjean, many parole officers and citizens keep a close watch on people that have committed crimes in the past no matter what the present looks like. Just like Jean Valjean, inmates on parole experience struggles of turning their life around and are almost forced to commit another crime just to stay alive. Hooper was able incorporate Valjean\\'s past to show the audience that people can indeed change no matter the circumstances. James Bernardinelli of Reelviews.net stated that Hooper \"draws inspiration as much from the source material as from the musical to result in an engaging production that is guaranteed to enthrall audiences\"(Berardinelli). With the inspiration of Jean Valjean\\'s attempt to recover his footing, the audience is able to become engaged and can relate.\\n\\nLes Miserables is viewed by critics as \"a must see\" and \"spectacular movie.\" This film was able to attain the awards it did by capturing the audiences\\' emotions and running with them. Hooper used the bad economy, hardships of war, and recidivism as direct connections from the film to its audience and I believe this connection made the film win the awards it did and gain as much success as it gained.

This film is made without irony\" (Wioszcyna, \"Tom Hooper \\'confused\\' by criticism of \\'Les Mis\\'\"). Tom Hooper, director for the box office hit Les Miserables (Hooper, 2012) defended his own film to interviewers when asked what he thought of some critics\\' response to his movie. Instead of caving to criticism, Hooper owned his movie had no postmodern charm of satire in it. While some critics view it a cheap and cheesy emotional manipulation, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) is a motion picture masterpiece because of the director\\'s innovation in on-screen musicals, honest expression of raw emotions without irony, and the way he portrayed the themes.\\n\\nLes Miserables (Hooper 2012) is an adaption of a Broadway musical to a movie. The complications with adapting a play to a screen are that the camera is a much more flexible medium than a stage and, specifically for musicals, the staged songs can seem forced and inorganic. However, director Tom Hooper and screenwriters were able to overcome theses difficulties. The camera work makes the play come alive as a video production. The singing in the film feels entirely organic because it was filmed on set. The actors actually had earpieces with a piano playing to keep them on key while they were shooting (IMBD.com). While the earpiece itself isn\\'t revolutionary, the piano on the other end created a new way to film musicals. During the movie, the actor or actress singing set the tempo and the piano played along to the tempo he or she sang on camera. By allowing the natural tempo of the actors and actresses to rule the scenes, the songs sound as if the characters wrote them.\\n\\nSome critics have pointed to the film\\'s lack of irony as cheap emotional manipulation. However, as the director Tom Hooper pointed out, the object of the film was not to lighten the emotional story by making it satirical (Wioszcyna, \"Tom Hooper \\'confused\\' by criticism of \\'Les Mis\\'\"). Through singing, the audience has a different emotional experience than in most movies. Crafted without irony in the plot, the movie sets a different tone. As New York Times critic Stanley Fish pointed out, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) defeats irony by not allowing the distance it requires. If you\\'re looking right down the throats of the characters, there is no space between them and you; their perspective is your perspective...\" (Fish, \"\\'Les Miserables\\' and Irony\"). Because the film keeps the audience in the world of the performer, irony would have been out of place for the movie, and the director made a wise decision to leave the tone out.\\n\\nThe themes in Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) would not have been conducive for irony. The main two characters represent competing themes: mercy and justice. Valjean continually shows mercy to those around him after his turning point at the priest\\'s house, Javert\\'s anthem is always justice- to give each what is his due. At the end of the film, the resolution between the two competing morals shows that it is better to forgive and forbear. While rated PG13 by the MPAA (IMDb.com), the lessons in the movie are actually very relevant for any age. Because of violence and some sexuality, the film is not advised for small children but the story and the themes teach important values.\\n\\nThrough the moving songs, the themes were really the highlight of the film. With the emotion of poetry, each line exuded what that character stood for and it displayed characters through a different light than prose script would have shown them. By using the tempo the singer or actor set on film, the organic notes accented the point of the story: mercy triumphs over justice. If irony had been written into the tone of the movie, it would have lessened the power of the words in the songs and detracted from that main theme. Each part of Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) highlights the main struggle between Javert and Valjean, making it a masterpiece. None of this would have been possible without the abilities of Tom Hooper as director and his vision for the film.\\n\\nAn excellent example of his expertise in directing, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) shows Tom Hooper\\'s innovation on screen, his wise judgment on the tone, and his masterful way of accenting and portraying the themes of the plot. Hooper\\'s decisions to create the film, knowing it could incite some criticism, shows that he is a masterful director willing to look outside of the box for solutions in order to create something he can proudly defend to critics. Innovation in the techniques and tone, make Hooper\\'s Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) worthy of the Oscars that it won.\\n\\nWorks Cited: Fish, Stanley.\"\\'Les Miserables\\' and Irony.\" Rev. of Les Miserables by Tom Hooper.

The story unfolds over many years in 19th century France, as the impoverished and middle class attempt to revolt against the monarchy.\\n\\nThe movie begins with the musical talent of Hugh Jackman, who plays Jean Valjean a prisoner set free after being confined to a life of dishonesty. But his life quickly changes as he chooses to pursue a journey towards redemption after breaking his parole. The events that progress afterward ultimately lead him to his final salvation with God, as he watches over Cosette, daughter of Fantine. After experiencing an awful childhood Cosette, played by the talented Amanda Seyfried, pursues a life of happiness that her mother always dreamed for her. The love that Fantine has for Cosette is so strong it is hard to portray on screen, but the actress behind the role had no issue.\\n\\nAcademy Award winner - Anne Hathaway plays the dramatic role as Fantine, a middle-class woman, who gives up just about everything - and I mean everything - to save her daughter. To say that Hathaway can sing is an understatement because anyone listening to her is directly drawn to her character and the story in which she is telling. Her song \"I Dreamed a Dream\" is filled with such raw emotion that even the most impassive person could empathize for this woman. But not to just give credit to Anne Hathaway, the whole cast had such mesmerizing voices that were so real and believable it was if was I was experiencing every little thing that they were going through. Not to mention that director Tom Hooper had each actor sing live during the screening process, meaning every voice heard on screen was real.\\n\\nTo me this is the key to a great movie, believability, not allowing one part of the film to fall short of another, and I can vouch for Director Tom Hooper when I say that he did just that. From the original novel, to the Broadway stage version, to a previous movie adaptation, and now to Hooper\\'s film revision, this classic tale has been used a lot. It is hard to keep the depth of a storyline when various directors attempt to draw a different type of audience, but Hooper was able to maintain all the key components to this historical masterpiece. Every scene, costume, song, and character flowed so well together that it was if you were to read straight from the original novel itself. There\\'s a strong complexity of emotion that needed to be kept from scene to scene, and the costuming and scenery only developed the passion within. The tiniest effects made the greatest difference in this timeless tale of Les Miserables. The dirt under the fingernails, the worn and tattered clothing, and the off kilter buildings only emphasized the tiredness and rebellion of the era.\\n\\nThis modern remake of Les Miserables is a groundbreaking production in the film industry; thanks to its talented cast and accurate portrayal of the French Revolution era during 19th France. Director Tom Hooper\\'s precision on the small details of the scenery, costuming, and cinematography only aided in the depth of the storyline, taking the audience back to this day and age. This movie is well worth the ticket, so why wait one day more? ', '10']\n",

It's a tale of love and loss, of obsession and hatred played out against the background of revolutionary France, and it's quite simply the best musical to come along for a good few years.\\n\\nMuch of the delight comes from the central pairing of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, both of whom are better than they've been for a good while. Each actors gives it his all, and they fill their roles with nobility, honour and feeling. I like the supporting cast less - Anne Hathaway is nothing to write home about in my mind, and didn't really deserve that Oscar - but Amanda Seyfried is better than she was in MAMMA MIA and Eddie Redmayne is reliable as always.\\n\\nAs a film, LES MISERABLES looks splendid, and THE KING'S SPEECH director Tom Hooper puts every penny of the budget up on screen. The songs are memorable and very well sung by the entire cast, and although I could have done without Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (both of whom seem to be repeating their parts from SWEENEY TODD) they're not too off-putting.

Not remembering the story, I was completely in the dark with what to expect from this movie. Quite honestly I was blown away and found it to be mesmerising.\\n\\nSome reviewers have complained that it's nowhere near as good as the live stage production but I think that these very same people are missing the point. This is an on screen adaptation of the very well known musical and there has to be some sort of bridge here. I'm sure those who live for the theatre would rather have the full Broadway crew cast for the film but for this to work on a more commercial level, you must have some well known actors. Okay, so they can't carry out the songs with the power and intensity of stage performers but you've got to say they did reasonably well considering.\\n\\nThe way I see it, for someone like myself who doesn't read books and just thoroughly enjoys film, it's really opened my mind and has given me more motivation now to go to the theatre, more than I ever would before.

The second thing is the Trade Federation. They are trying to get the queen to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. There is no way to defend this, that is just plain stupid.

            "603 ) ['(This is my review after watching the prequel trilogy in detail for the first time as an adult.)\\n\\nThe original trilogy of Star Wars established an immediately recognizable style of visual storytelling that, while constantly being reworked and dumbed down by subsequent special editions, has remained largely intact for the viewers of today. The stories were epic in scope, deftly utilizing archetypal characters and plot arcs, all while wrapping it into a new and exciting \"space opera\" package. This, I think, is how Episode I steps off on the wrong foot. I would argue that the story of Anakin is reasonably compelling in its overall execution; it\\'s more the many less-than-ideal production decisions that detract from the timelessness that defined the originals.\\n\\nPerhaps the most glaring of these choices is the gratuitous overuse of CGI. Please, George Lucas, just stop. His zeal for adding in splashy computer graphics over old practical effects in the special editions has gone completely unchecked here, and since it is the earliest of the three prequel films, the level of advancement in CGI technology had not made it nearly far enough to be a reasonable alternative to practical effects. (The one exception is CGI Yoda, which replaced the original puppet Yoda in the theatrical release who looked even worse.) As a viewer in 2017, the vast majority of these are just inexcusably bad and unnecessary.\\n\\nI\\'m slightly less bothered by how the rest of the story unfolds. For the most part it holds up: the political maneuvering, the crisis on Naboo, the journey to Tatooine and Anakin\\'s struggle to free himself and his mother from slavery, and of course, \"the phantom menace\" of Darth Maul and Palpatine. Somehow the slightly lazier pace of this movie made it feel more realistic, like there wasn\\'t *always* a dire, civilization-threatening crisis going on for these people. There\\'s enough conflict among the characters in their own lives to keep it interesting.\\n\\nThat being said, the character development is far below what I would expect from Star Wars. While all the Star Wars movies are very plot-driven, having relatable characters is incredibly important, and the combination of stiff acting and bad screen writing just doesn\\'t cut it here with the likes of Qui-Gon, Anakin, Padme, or God forbid Jar-Jar. And Anakin *really* should have been more like 12 or 13. Having a seven-year-old spout the lines that he did, and with whatever attraction Padme had for him, would have been many times less cringey had he been about five years older.\\n\\nEpisode I takes what could\\'ve been a successful formula and makes it much less so with poor casting, screen writing, and production. I think if George Lucas and his team had taken this in a more refined, more thoughtful direction, it could have been great. Sadly that wasn\\'t the case. ', '6']\n",

I disagree with all this.\\n\\nI grew up loving the phantom menace just as much as the other Star Wars movies as a kid. Growing up, I now see some of its issues but not nearly as much as I thought I would. This movie is really good.\\n\\nThe Phantom Menace is about the Trade Federation trying to take over Naboo.

Amongst all of this, the sith who have been extinct for a very long time resurge.\\n\\nI think this is a really interesting story and it's well executed. One of two main issues that I have with the movie is in the story. Qui Gon & co spend way too much time on Tatoine.

He's really not as annoying as another character I'll talk about later. Anyway, it's a really good story.\\n\\nThe characters are great in this movie. Liam Neeson as Qui Gon and Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan definitely steal the show. they are really well developed characters. It's so sad to see Qui Gon die at the end.

Those people clearly haven't recently rewatched the film. There's only about 15 minutes of counsel meetings in total and I found them rather interesting. They showed how dysfunctional the republic was. That being said, this movie is pretty action packed whether you want to admit or not. Short negotiations, an epic podrace, a race through Naboo, a short first Darth Maul duel, a war between the Gungans and the droids, another race through Naboo and the main palace and of course an epic lightsaber duel. This movie is far from boring. Another reason why this movie is awesome is because during the epic final lightsaber duel, we see Jedi in their prime. In the old Star Wars movies, Jedi were extinct, a myth. In this one, we see them at their most badass.\\n\\nLike I said, this movie expands on the Star Wars universe. We get to see another era of this universe. One where the Jedi aren't a myth and are very present. An era where Sith were extinct.

But that's only because at the time, I had virtually no interest in Star Wars at all. One day after watching a review of the films, I decided to give the movies a try, and see if they were worth all the fame they have. But little did I know that when I first hit 'play' on that DVD menu, i had taken my first step into a larger world.\\n\\nIn the first half, I thought that the CGI and effects looked great. Now let me just say something for a second: Most people dislike the Prequels for overuse of CGI and not enough real things. But to me, the wonder and mystery of Episodes IV-VI works in a different way. Seeing all of the CGI in the Podrace, the Droids, and a few of the characters, I was stunned. I had never seen CG quality to such an extent before, and much of it really did look real. I had wondered how much work it must've taken to put it all together with the lighting and textures and stuff.\\n\\nNow that we've gotten that out of the way, we can move on. Personally, I didn't really find that much to complain about. I was able to follow the story just fine, and i thought the characters were really interesting. Anakin as a child didn't bother me at all, and i thought he was pretty likable. He had an interesting character, and I kind of actually felt sorry for him since he lived on such a dusty old planet such as Tatooine. When Jar Jar Binks first appeared, I feared the worst based on some of the reviews I saw. But in the first minute or so, Jar Jar actually didn't bother me at all. In fact, I thought he was quite entertaining and funny. For example, when he got his head stuck in the pod race electrical line, I was laughing out of control.\\n\\nNow let me explain something else for a moment: Some people may argue that that comedy doesn't belong in a Star wars movie. But to debunk that, I'm only going to say this: In the Empire Strikes Back, remember when Yoda first appeared?...\\n\\nNear the middle of the film came the saga's first chronological lightsaber dual, between Qui Gon Jinn and Darth maul, the movie's secondary antagonist. his motive is to wipe out the Jedi and overthrow the Galactic Republic as a a way of getting revenge. (Anyone who paid attention during the Jedi Council parts would know that the Jedi wiped out the Sith a long time ago, and Darth Maul is the apprentice of one of the last Sith Lords who want the Sith to come back.\\n\\nNow that that's out of the way, let's move on. In the second half of the film, the effects only got better. The Naboo Starfighters near the end looked seriously real, the trade Federation battleship looked pretty wicked, and the battle between the gungans and the battle droids looked spectacular, but soon after this happened, came the highlight of the film. While the Theed palace soldiers are trying to take back the palace, they ran into Darth Maul, who had been sent by his master to kill the two Jedi and everyone who stood in their way to victory.\\n\\nAfter that came the second best lightsaber fight in the entire saga. For one thing, Darth Maul has a double bladed (duel bladed) lightsaber. And I thought it was nice to see an update on the lightsaber formula. Anyway, when the fight starts, three key factors make it a great fight. 1 is the music, called Duel of Fates. no words can describe how well this piece of John Williams Gold fits into the fight, and the film in general. The second factor is the movements, or choreography. For the first time, we were introduced to lightsaber duels with back flips, jumps, several hits a second, and some seriously fast paced action, which the Original films seriously lacked from the reviews. And the third thing that makes the fight so great is the location its in. The Theed Palace reactor is such a bad ass place to have a lightsaber fight, its almost as if Darth Maul purposely waited nearby it so they could fight there. Overall, just watch the fight on Youtube and you'll see what I mean.\\n\\nOverall, The Phantom Menace was a great entry in the Star Wars franchise. It's got great effects, lovable characters, a great storyline, and doesn't deserve all of the hate that it has. I highly recommend watching this any day.\\n\\nI'd give this a 15 if I could. \", '10']\n",

I wouldn't say it's the worst but I would easily say it's the weakest in terms of helping the series forward.\\n\\nWith that aside, I will list off the things I like and don't like here. I believe that the acting is pretty sound for the most part, the man exception just being Natalie Portman who I though that while a great actress, was not really good in this movie or the other two prequels. I have to give Jake Lloyd a pass since he was a kid. But Liam Neeson, Ian McDirmand, and Ewan Mcgregor all did great jobs. The effects were also really amazing and also so for the time. The fight and actions scenes were fantastic. And the planet of Coursant, while the scene on the end of itself is boring, is a really nice setting place.\\n\\nAs for negatives, I feel that pacing is way off. I have no problem with the whole political story line or anything since there already was political stories in the Star Wars universe and this expanded it, so maybe that was needed. But with the pacing it's just awful. At one moment we're talking politics then the next we are in a spacehsip to a desert and then we have a race and then we are talking politics again and then we are in a giant battle and then a funeral and how to handle Anakin and then politics again. I just wish that it picked one or two themes and sticked with it.\\n\\nOverall, it isn't that bad of a movie. I have some issues with it, but as a whole it could have been a lot worse.

Science Fiction had always been a major event with moviegoers and in 1977 they would get the thrill of a lifetime because of a film that some felt wouldn't make it. It was followed by two sequels and that appeared to be the end, but that would change over two decades later.

Exciting pace. Mind-blowing costume and production designs. Some excellent action and fight scenes. Some fantastic new worlds and creatures. Quite well written. A lot of gorgeous scenery.\\n\\nCons: The character of Jar Jar Binks is frustrating because on one hand he's harmless and kind of cute, but is also an obvious comic relief and ends up serving little purpose beyond that.

Ahmed Best does the voice of Jar Jar Binks, and it\\'s true of what a lot people say about his character, he is certainly unfunny and annoying.

And I believe most of the sheer hype for this film was the fact that It was a George Lucas film, who brought the impacting and hugely popular idea \"Star Wars\" to the world back in May of 1977.\\n\\nBut does this film live up to its hope? No. Not at all.\\n\\nThe premise of this \"new trilogy\" is to to follow the story of Anakin Skywalker, who later becomes the iconic movie villain, Darth Vader. Now this idea in general isn\\'t bad, Since it would be difficult to follow what would happen after Episode 6, and would definitely take lots of time, thinking and effort. But the glaring issue with this prequel storyline is that it only seems impactful and interesting until Episode 3.\\n\\nWith that said, the film isn\\'t remotely entertaining. Its way of putting things together seems sloppy and looks much more like filler and a marketing move than actual lore, But the lackluster characters don\\'t help much at all.\\n\\nMost of the characters that appear in this film are not memorable or likable at all, theirs characters like Qui Gon who only seem to slow things down, Characters like Jar Jar who seems to be a failed marketing subject, and just comes down to look like \"forced humor\" that the fans has since just found annoying.\\n\\nAnother glaring issue is its heavy political dialogue. Now since this movie is mainly aimed at new generations of future Star Wars, this film decides to bore the ENTIRE audience with political dialogue, Which doesn\\'t seem to fit at all, which shortens the attention span of the viewers who are watching Star Wars, not a CNN Broadcast who are covering today\\'s news on the state of modern society.\\n\\nThe enemies, or antagonists that are in the film aren\\'t that bad. The droids, the Separatist ground forces could\\'ve been threatening,Mainly because of the standard troopers spouting random dialogue like \"Roger Roger!\" In high pitched voices of them really rule down their intimidation. I wish they would be more like Terminators, not quite exactly like them, but more the ruthlessness and almost unstoppable features, which would make them seem like an actual threat. However the types of machinery like the Destroyer Droids are actually really creative and well made.\\n\\nI also really like the fact that Palpatine\\'s true motives are a mystery and his plot to rule the galaxy is growing, To me this is one of the best features of the prequels, It\\'s almost like he is the overall embodiment of the Dark Side. Darth Maul, the apprentice of Palpatine had potential, But didn\\'t have very many screen-time at all, which sucked.\\n\\nA aspect that isn\\'t necessary is the movie taking place while Anakin is an 8 year old boy. If they were to make him a little older his overall character would be more relate-able and interesting, Which is one of the things Episode 4 did so well with Luke. Anakin didn\\'t even have to be Luke\\'s age, he could\\'ve been a at least a little older so he would mold with the overall story much better.\\n\\nThe film also has trouble with scenes that seem out of place, or just there for added marketing, Which is very aggravating. For example, we have the Famous pod-racing segment, Which Anakin volunteers to do since the winning payment will allow the protagonists to buy another hyper- drive system, which is their ticket out of the Outer Rim. But this is clearly there sourly for the purpose of making Video Games based on this specific scene. And Anakin accidentally destroying a CIS control ship just seems unrealistic and strange.\\n\\nThe use of CGI in this movie is mediocre in a sense that sometimes its used right and sometimes it doesn\\'t seem necessary. For example, the CG effects helped enhance the Lightsaber battles, they look more fluent and are much more entertaining to watch. But some of the different species look just awful because of their CG.\\n\\nThe Final act somewhat borrows what Episode 6 did, having the final act having different things going on. It worked well for Episode 6 but here it seems like there is too much going on.\\n\\nThe only one of these I found fitting was the duel with Darth Maul. Its the best part of this film. Its one of the only scenes that is honestly enjoyable.\\n\\nThe Track \"Duel of the Fates\" that goes with it is simply incredible. Its powerful orchestra elements and the sheer power of the chorus makes this one of the greatest tracks in film history, And i\\'m not kidding.\\n\\nAnd this leads me to my final point with this film, Its incredible musical score by John Williams himself, who\\'s music actually improved the films scenes and movie itself. Without John Williams score, this film would be almost nothing.\\n\\nOverall, Though its flaws may be evident It can be enjoyable, since its Star Wars after all. But if your looking for a superb Star Wars experience, skip this one. But if your looking for something to watch, then give this one a shot. Its not exactly good, but it certainly has its moments.

I genuinely enjoyed watching it and especially loved seeing the beginnings of the Star Wars franchise\\'s plot unfold. I\\'m not ashamed to say I cried at one part, the progression of the story of Anakin growing up as a slave, being recognized as an almost force of nature so strongly connected to the force, being encouraged to leave his planet and mother to be trained, and ultimately starting his path of pain and sorrow. I think Qui-Gon did not foresee Anakin having such a difficult life and wanted to believe he would bring balance rather than pain to the galaxy. However, Anakin\\'s life never really having stability and his desires to be having never being met hit me hard, I\\'m not joking. The Star Wars franchise can indeed be entitled \"The Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker,\" and this movie The Phantom Menace sets the plot up so well that Anakin had to go through so much struggle to bring balance and it was difficult to digest imagining that he was *destined* to suffer almost, willed by the Force to destroy the Sith even by helping destroy the Jedi Order and what would inhibit the Jedi from ever defeating the Sith. Watching the movie unfold and observing how Darth Sidious tried to manipulate, successfully, nearly all the events that took place was incredible.

As for Anakin\\'s acting, I\\'m surprised to say I thought it was good for his place. He is a ~10 year old child and I think for a child actor, he did an extremely good job.

I give the film an 8/10, it deserves it, definitely for that last fight scene...probably the best fight scene in all of Star Wars, for myself anyways.

            "621 ) [\"The biggest cinematic event of 1999, George Lucas' film was eagerly awaited by literally millions of fans, young and old, for over a year before it finally arrived in the cinemas and, as expected, broke box office records. Everyone looked forward to the film, and you can't blame them, as the first three Star Wars films were all box office hits, milestones in special effects, and all rightly deserve their classic status. As the writing appeared on screen and the music began, I was fidgeting in my cinema seat with excitement. Unfortunately, Lucas appears to have somewhat lost his touch in the twenty years which have separated the films, and this prequel is nowhere near as good as it could have been.\\n\\nThe faults are obvious, and, to a degree, predictable. Predictably enough, there is a visual overload of special effects overwhelming the screen at every opportunity, so many in fact that you soon become immune to the initial amazement of seeing how good they are. They can't be faulted. Every year, CGI just keeps getting better and better and more and more realistic, and the special effects are great. They're not realistic at all, but they look good. I mean, this is the first film to have a computer image as a central character (which freely mingles with the human actors) and in which you really come to forget that it's not real, and you treat it with exactly the same feelings as the actors on screen. Ja Ja Biggs is annoying, yes, but in that respect he is human too. Sadly with so many visual effects bombarding us they quickly become boring, and you realise that the film is desperately in need of some characterisation - a major failing which totally ruins Lucas' intended effect.\\n\\nIn the first three films we cared about and felt for Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and all the others, but you don't give a damn in this epic where all the actors do is interact with their computer surroundings and accomplices. And in this way the film is typical of late '90s cinema, where special effects bonanzas like VOLCANO and MEN IN BLACK are full of great FX but little else. In the extended chase sequence in the middle of the film, you get the feel you're watching a video game rather than an actual film, with it looking so unrealistic. Another major fault of the film is that the plot is rather boring. For three quarters of the film not a lot happens, with people talking about tax interspersed with some lame fight scenes, and it's not until the last half an hour that things really hot up and get exciting. I don't know about you, but I never expected Star Wars to be boring. Most scenes appear to be rehashes of moments from the original trilogy, but they're never as interesting, partly because as I mentioned before you don't actually give two hoots about any of the characters.\\n\\nSpeaking of the characters leads me on to the actors, obviously an ensemble cast picked from the creme of top Hollywood stars, leading me to wonder if they were in fact picked for their looks rather than their acting ability. For instance, Natalie Portman looks very fragile as the Queen of Naboo, but her acting is barely existent and she is given little to do. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are top billed as the main stars, but they are given woefully little to do other than walk around, and occasionally jump about a bit. Of the two, Neeson is by far the best, and also my favourite actor in this film. Jake Lloyd appears as a young Darth Vader, but it's difficult to imagine him being remotely threatening, more like a typical American child actor, marginally less whiny than most. Samuel Jackson is given only a couple of scenes, but hopefully he will appear more in the next two films, while Brian Blessed lends only his voice to a comic relief alien character. However it's the returning actors from the original who are the most interesting, and it's great to see Kenny Baker and Anthony Daniels reprise their famous roles as the Laurel and Hardy of the robot world, R2D2 and C3PO. They appear only briefly. Ian McDiarmid reprises his role as the evil Emperor from Return of the Jedi, and is brilliant as Senator Palpatine, the stern but good leader. McDiarmid is very authoritative and successfully mixes his allegiance to good in the role with hints of the powerful, evil figure that he will eventually become.\\n\\nThe action sequences in this film range from the mediocre to the poor. The space battles offer nothing new and, to be honest, they were done much better and with more finesse twenty years ago. The light sabre fights with the robots also become boring very quickly, and there are only so many different ways McGregor and Neeson can kill their CGI nemesis. The action happens all very quickly and efficiently, but lacks any sparkle or excitement, or indeed adrenaline. The special effects, probably some of the best CGI I have ever seen in an underwater sequence with gigantic fish attacking a small craft are quite realistic, but I don't think the filmmakers have realised that you need something more than that yet. The music is also very average and the classic themes we all recognise from the first trilogy are sorely underused. The Phantom Menace is disappointing, and nowhere near as good as the originals, but I suppose the mere status of it makes it required viewing, even if it really is this bad. All I can say is that it makes me feel dubious about the next film. Let's hope it's more impressive than this misfiring, below average attempt to rekindle the - much-missed - epic flame. \", '2']\n",

I am just disappointed that Darth Maul was killed, I mean yes they returned him in Clone Wars, nut I hoped for more of him in the prequels. Besides that, movie was great.

George Lucas was aiming for the stars with this new take on the saga, however he never even took off and he failed to meet fan expectation for the most part. Amazingly though there are some positives to this film that will always be remembered and rightly so.\\n\\nThe first positive of the film are the two main leads of Qui Gon-Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi who are portrayed by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor respectively. Both of them are really good and memorable for there character interactions and. Neeson and McGregor both bring their game for this film both interns of acting and stunt work which really pays off at the end fight with Darth Maul. It is such a shame that this was the only Star Wars film that Liam Neeson as in because there was great sense of bravery and charm to the character that no one else could pull off. He also had the feeling of the old Obi-Wan Kenobi character from A New Hope which meant that the audience could related to him and have an emotional connection to the character. Also seeing a young Obi- Wan Kenobi for the first time was also really cool and seeing him be the learner instead of the master, was a really interesting angle and cleverly done.\\n\\nThe next positive is the pod race which even to this day still looks really cool and shows the revolutionary special effects that were used at that time. It is heart pounding non-stop action from start to finish. So much so that when Anakin and Sebulba come together your not completely sure which one of them will come out on top. The fast paced nature of the editing and accompanied with the great score real works to build a thrilling action scene.\\n\\nTalking of the score of the film that is another positive to this. Unlike The Force Awakens and Rogue One, The Phantom Menace has more memorable score to it. Esecically during the pod racer which is very good and also during the climactic battle between the two Jedi and Maul. That score at the end of the film during the lightsaber battle will go down in Star Wars history, even gives me chills to this today, fantastic.\\n\\nThe final positive of the film is the lightsaber battle between Qui Gon-Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul, which is and was a huge step up from the original trilogy. If there is one complaint from the original trilogy it is that the lightsaber battles weren't very extravagant and where very controlled, especially in A New Hope. This film fantastically ups the anti with the end duel which is non-stop right from the get go and is truly magical. Great choreography of the fight, fits perfectly with the score and the editing.\\n\\nNow the negatives, oh boy this section of the review might actually be quite small because words probably can't describe some of the negatives in this film. Firstly Jake Lloyd as a young Anakin Skywalker, *sigh*, in a way I actually feel sorry for him because isn't all completely 100% his fault for the portrayal, some it does fall on Lucas. Hateful,Irritating,annoying,bad,terrible are just some of the words to describe his performance .\\n\\nThe next negative is the story which is predominately about invasion and trade deals/negotiations,Zzzzzzzzzz, wow I almost feel asleep writing that down, who I sat away for just over 2 hours of it. Uninteresting and needlessly over complicated, this film goes on and on and on about trade deals and then all of a sudden there is a massive fight and then the end of the film. Could of.......No it should have been better, I suppose there is some credit for Lucas trying something different. However if you are going to try something different you've got to 100% that its not going back on anything that has been done before.........midichlorians...cough.......\\n\\nNext Jar Jar Binks................*sigh*................nope.......*kill myself*\\n\\nSome of the CGI looks dated, whether it be the locations or droid/Gungan fight. Some of the effects have not stood the test of time which is sad and amazing considering that the original trilogy effects do hold up for the most part. Also the droids, what a waste of time, I accepted that the prequels had to try something different from stormtroopers but the droids are not treating in any way. There are just a throw away character from the good guys to kill a lot of.\\n\\nFinally the film does have some good moments and even a few moments that will go down in cinematic history however the many negatives of this film way it down so much that it can't recover. Sadly there are more negative moments that will go down in cinematic history rather than positive ones, 40% out of 100 bad overall not a good star to the prequel trilogy. \", '4']\n",

For a start Ray Park as Darth Maul is one of the most bad ass characters to come out or Star Wars at all, even If he got cut in half way too soon. Also as per usual with Star Wars, John Williams's work in this movie's soundtrack is, awesome. And last and I'm not even sure, If It's least but the fact that Ian McDiarmid was able to come back to the role of Palpatine is a triumph for the series as a whole. Now that all the good parts are talked about, Star Wars Episode I is a bloated CGI mess of George Lucas's mind. And you know what, Jake Lloyd is annoying as little Anakin, the CGI is damn near insulting but ... nothing in this movie is as bad ass Jar Jar Binks, he is literally the worst thing to have ever come out of cinema. Period. And I've seen Battlefield Earth. And to be honest I could spend hours talking about how terrible Binks is but one more thing I have to talk about is the mistreatment of Ewan McGreggor and Liam Neeson in this movie. It's commonly agreed upon that Ewan McGreggor was the best thing about the prequel trilogy but in this movie he's given the worst dialogue and is humiliated whenever he's on screen and as is Liam Neeson who sadly doesn't even get a chance to make up for his character. The supporting cast of this movie puts great actors in all the wrong places, Terrence Stamp is a politician that gets 5 minutes of screen time, Sam Jackson is a quiet diplomat and Brian Blessed ... actually Blessed is a welcome relief as Boss Nass but most surprisingly, the one actor I don't mind in this movie is Natalie Portman playing Padme a.k.a Queen Amidala, she's kind and caring yet she also takes no crap from anyone ...

I actually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't listen to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is intended to be and how it's to be structured. On it's own, I'd probably rate it as a six or seven out of 10. But as a part of a larger story, it gets a 10 out of 10 cause in the long run, it's the very elements of what happens in the film that really make it matter in the Star Wars saga. If you disagree with me about what I say the structure is, just send me a message or place a comment.\\n\\nI saw The Phantom Menace twice in 3-D. The first time was the day it was released Feb., 10 and the second time was with my sister on the Feb., 20. Overall, I thought the post 3-D conversion was fairly impressive and it was worth seeing it again after nearly 13 years of its original release. Probably the most impressive 3-D shots were with the holograms and some lightsaber fight scenes. You could also see Jar Jar's tongue stick out of the screen in one shot. My eyes did strain a little bit at times with the transition from shots that were dark and kind of dole colored to very bright colored shots. But that's my only problem with the 3-D conversion. It was worth going to see again and recommend to any hard core star wars and general moviegoers. \", '10']\n",

            "626 ) ['There are few franchises that have attained the following that George Lucas\\' brilliant space-opera \"Star Wars\" has earned over it\\'s near forty year history. In many ways, it\\'s gone far beyond what anyone could have imagined and has become a permanent fixture in pop- culture entertainment, practically having transcended the term \"film\" and now become more a devout religion to many. It\\'s a certified and undeniable phenomena with fans the world over. So 1999\\'s release \"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace\" was not just a movie... it was an event. A chance to revisit that galaxy far, far away and to explore the seeds that would be sewn to create that original masterpiece of a trilogy that began back in 1977.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we all know how it turned out. While by no means an atrocious film, \"The Phantom Menace\" is a tragically divisive and objectively middling and mediocre continuation of the beloved saga. For every one thing it does right, it does another thing dreadfully wrong. For every major step forward in terms of scope and action, it takes another step back in terms of character and narrative. It\\'s very much a troubled film, peppered with hints of brilliance in between the head-scratching moments of misjudgments and pandering.\\n\\nSet some time before the events of \"A New Hope\", Jedi Knights Qui- Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent on a mission to negotiate with the dreaded Trade Federation in an attempt to stop a blockade around the small and peaceful planet of Naboo. However, the negotiations are ended before they begin, and the Jedi Knights are forced to try and protect Naboo\\'s Queen Amidala and her handmaidens including Padme (Natalie Portman) when the Federation invades under order from the evil Darth Sidious. On the way to the Galactic Capital, the Jedi and Queen are forced to land on Tattooine, where they meet young slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and take him in after a harrowing series of events. Soon enough, the stage is set for the ultimate battle between Naboo\\'s remaining forces and the Federation\\'s army of robotic minions.\\n\\nThe biggest failing of the film is really not what many make it out to be. It\\'s not the contrived and shoehorned comedic spoutings of supporting character Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), nor the questionable acting of the cast or the over-reliance on computer- generated digital effects. Honestly, the biggest problem is the pacing and the subject matter at large. It\\'s a very specific combination of both jarring and boring, with no real sense of internal structure to keep it grounded or moving along at a consistent pace. Early scenes go by in mere moments while later developments stretch on and on with seemingly no end. It\\'s as though George Lucas couldn\\'t find a way to reconcile his desire to create a more heady variation of the franchise while still delivering the thrills and action that fans craved. The result is a mish mash effort that\\'s sometimes frustrating to watch because it feels inorganically built and edited. The subject matter just also clashes so badly with the universe as established in the earlier films. Droning conversations about trade negotiations and shaky politics feel so out of place ad it really bogs the film down. It\\'s far too unfamiliar. Yes, a certain degree of shake-ups are nice to keep a franchise fresh... but it still has to have some consistency.\\n\\nAlthough I definitely would be lying if I didn\\'t address the other issues that fans commonly complain about as very valid. The dialog is often robotic and forced, leading to characters feeling flat and artificial. The humor is ratcheted up to such a degree that the film borders on the juvenile more than once in an unsettling way. There are many misjudgments in the development taken that seem contrary to what made \"Star Wars\" the series it was. And all too often character development is thrown out the window for non-stop action and bizarrely long dialog exchanges about vague topics like treachery in the Galactic Senate or the villains musing ominously about finally attaining \"revenge.\"\\n\\nStill, there is a bit of fun to be had here, and as I said above, there are hints of a much better movie from time to time. The film presents the biggest scope thus far in the \"Star Wars\" universe, and the visuals and world-building were top-notch for the time. The action was massively thrilling to audiences back in the day and it was great fun finally seeing real Jedi in their prime waging battle against deadly enemies. Even with performances stilted by the wonky dialog, everyone was very well cast and there were a few stand-out roles... particularly McGregor\\'s Obi-Wan, who was cast perfectly. And though it wavered, there was just such a magic to finally returning to this incredible world that Lucas had established so long ago. It might not have been the \"Star Wars\" we wanted... but it was still \"Star Wars.\"\\n\\nAs it stands, \"The Phantom Menace\" is still very much the weakest installment of the \"Star Wars\" legacy, though it has just enough of an entertainment factor to make it worth seeing at least once for series fans. It\\'s uneven and shoddily assembled with ill-developed characters and an over-reliance on effects and kid-friendly comedy. But it\\'s action-packed and often thrilling to behold, and it definitely has its moments despite its numerous issues.\\n\\nAnd so I\\'m giving \"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace\" a very middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10. It\\'s neither particularly good nor particularly bad. ', '5']\n",

Liam Neeson as Qui Gon, Duel Of Fates, Darth Maul and his Lightsabre, Natalie Portman gives her best performance in the trilogy, the end battle and even though it ran too long, and he never could have won with all that happened, the Pod Race.\\n\\nI\\'m also surprised no other movie has hit on Natalie Portman and Kiera Knightley looking so alike too.\\n\\nThe negatives are some awful dialogue (OK all Star Wats movies have awful dialogue, but this takes the biscuit!!) \"Are you an angel?\" And in fact anything Anakin says, especially during the final battle are especially bad. It\\'s not Jake Lloyds fault, I think he is fine. It\\'s Lucas who have him the cringe worthy words. Speaking of the final battle.... An alleged experienced pilot like Anakin pressed two buttons (starting his spaceship and activating auto pilot) looking for the trigger to the gun, before he actually grabs the obvious control!! Most of the movie is about federation tax (Yawn) there are some serious plot holes (why is technology more advanced than in the previous three movies, which are set in the future?? What happened to the blockade of the planet?? Why were Qui Gon and Padme still with Anakin when they hear about the sand storm) we don\\'t see the Jedi do anything except destroy droids till the end. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused, and it definitely needs some trimming here and there, do we really need all the repeated reaction shots (like when Padme reveals she is the Queen) and one of the biggest sins for me is, Darth Maul is a real bad ass, and they kill him off in the the first movie (and would he really just stand there and let Obi Wan flip over him, instead of slicing him in half??) What a waste.\\n\\nI\\'ll state here I don\\'t hate Jar Jar, mainly because both of my kids were fans of his growing up.

I grew up with the original trilogy and had pretty much all the available toys when I was younger (Still have them!). When a new trilogy was announced it was like all my Christmases coming at once. I avoided as much of the publicity as I could, only watching the trailer and skipping any magazine articles on the subject. I wanted to enjoy the film and have nothing influencing it. I knew who was in it but that was about it. However it was hard to avoid all the negative information that was spreading. As much as I tried I knew that this film was largely not well liked. This didn't bother me after all it was Star Wars, how bad could it be? I went to the cinema in anticipation and sat down. Then it started. STAR WARS came upon the screen and the hairs on the back of my neck stood up. This was it. The yellow text started scrolling up the screen and I couldn't help but smile. The smile of a true fan.\\n\\nThe film starts out with two Jedi Knights arriving on the planet Naboo. Once there they are soon fighting for their lives. When they flee the planet they take with them the Naboo Queen, her guard and a native of the planet Jar Jar Binks. During the film we are introduced to a variety of characters and plenty of mystery. The end of the film is a showdown between the Jedi Knights and a mysterious alien that pushes them to their limits. The new 3D conversion is good although maybe unnecessary. It adds a new dimension to the film and on the huge cinema screen draws you in even more.\\n\\nThe film looks amazing, as only a Star Wars film can. Using modern filmmaking techniques George Lucas creates a film like you have never seen before just like he did with the original films. Once again he uses a mixture of established actors including Liam Neeson, Warwick Davis, Kenny Baker, Anthony Daniels, Terence Stamp, Brian Blessed, Samuel L. Jackson, & Ian McDiarmid and up and coming stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ray Park, Dominic West & Keira Knightley. George Lucas has a talent for finding the perfect person for the role. The cast is excellent and make the best of their parts. What George Lucas isn't known for is his script writing. Once again, just like the first Star Wars film it doesn't make much sense at first but this is what all the haters of this film fail to see. This isn't a single film, it is the first of three films. When viewed as a trilogy it all falls into place. There is a reason for everything. Yes, the character of Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but he eventually serves to be the downfall of the galaxy. Many people were too busy hating him and ignoring his appearance in the following films to grasp this. Also yes, Ewan McGregor appears to be terrible in this, but he was meant to be that way. He is playing a character that is still finding his way in the universe and relies on his master for guidance. View the character in the following film and you will see the maturity and wisdom of the character all through the brilliant acting skills of Ewan McGregor, the stand out performance of the film.\\n\\nSome films shouldn't be over analysed and just enjoyed and this is one of those. This film is Star Wars like no one had ever experienced it before. The lightsaber battles are incredible, the space battle spectacular and the use of CGI is second to none. I don't know what everyone else who saw this expected but it was exactly what I wanted.\\n\\nThe original film is known as a master piece in film making using techniques never seen before. It is also know for bad acting, terrible script and bad direction. But so is this one. It used effects never seen before and it also has all the flaws of the original film. But it is hated! Look at the original film now as if you have never seen it before. It is bad. But it is bad in a good way and put with the next two films it all falls into place to make a great story. This is also true of the prequel films. Individually they all have flaws, together the flaws don't matter. This is Star Wars! When you first saw them some of you were probably children. You got lost in the experience and they blew your mind. You saw the new ones as a cynical grown up with your lives full of responsibility and maturity and the experience was wasted on you.

Besides, people seem to hate this movie because it's boring. Well, the part where Palptine is trying to convince the senate that he is eligible for the rank of chancellor can be interesting if you just PAY ATTENTION!!! Also, people think young Anakin Skywalker is annoying for the most stupid reasons ever made. He's not a brat, or a bad kid... SO WHY!!!

It was fantastic through the eyes of a child, something George was clearly trying to do. Now I am an adult, and watching it through the eyes of one, I can see all the mistakes, but that does not make the movie bad.\\n\\nFor one, Star Wars has always been a series that has been aimed at children. Yes adults like it also, but Star Wars is not just popular for its films, but for its video games, toys and books. Most of which are for children. This film was great and it showed one of the best adventures of the 90s. When people complain about this film, their excuse is usually the same: too much CGI, poor acting and poor writing and poor direction.\\n\\nYes the CGI is a bit dated, but it was really spectacular in some scenes. The acting was great in this film, as it was in the next two. The only actor who didn't give the best, was the young Jake Lloyd. It would be unfair to criticise the performance of someone who was a child at the time, of course he was not going to give a Al Pacino performance. The writing is OK, I guess, but really ask yourself this - what Star Wars film has good writing? None. They all have fantastic stories, which is why people love these films so much.\\n\\nGeorge did a great job at expanding on his already loved saga. He gave us new worlds, new characters and showed us the Jedi Order, something we have been wanting to see for a long time. This film is a joyful adventure, with a great story.\\n\\nThe character of Jar Jar is often another point of hate from 'older fans'. 'OLDER' fans. To a child, Jar Jar is a funny, clumsy stupid alien who acts insane, much like many Disney cartoon characters. I have a child of my own, and she thinks Jar Jar is hilarious, she is always pointing and laughing at him. THIS IS WHAT GEORGE WANTED!\\n\\nThis film will always be criticised by people who just don't like it, or don't want to like it. But this is not a bad film. It starts of an adventure which would eventually lead to episode 6, and the future movies.

            "633 ) ['Ladies and gentlemen of IMDb, I know you\\'ve spent many, many years watching or reading countless reviews bashing this movie. What I need to tell you won\\'t take very long at all; I don\\'t like \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\" I don\\'t expect you to like it. It has oodles of horrendous dialogue even by the low standards of the Saga, it\\'s been a destructive force in the reputation of the otherwise underrated and masterful \"Star Wars\" prequels, it joins \"The Force Awakens\" as one of only two \"Star Wars\" movies I refuse to watch when marathoning the Saga. I don\\'t like it. But this isn\\'t a popularity contest. It\\'s a movie review. And subjective opinions aside...\"The Phantom Menace\" IS a good movie.\\n\\nI\\'ll start out with the cons, as there are some EXTREMELY big ones. First of, Jar Jar Binks. While some people take the hatred of the character too far (Calling him a racist stereotype? SERIOUSLY?), he\\'s still pretty unfunny and just downright detestable. I am a fervent believer in the \"Darth Jar Jar\" theory which insists that Jar Jar was ORIGINALLY intended to be a dark mirror to Yoda (The seemingly insignificant, annoying comic relief-esque character who turns out to possess great wisdom, power and knowledge), but because the idea was abandoned after Jar Jar\\'s awful fan reception, he just ends up as a wholly distracting and painfully irritating failed \"comedic\" character. A shame, as if previously mentioned fan theory were correct and followed through, we could have had a villain as epic and sinister in scale as the Emperor himself.\\n\\nThe child actors are absolutely abysmal. Jake Lloyd as little Anakin Skywalker is JUST as bad as everyone says he is. Every time he opens his mouth to speak, I get a little tingle in my fingers to press the mute button to silence his wooden, obnoxious delivery. True, he\\'s not helped by the fact the film features some of the worst dialogue in the Saga (\"Are you an angel?\"), but I can easily imagine a child actor like Daeg Faerch or Brady Allen running circles around Lloyd\\'s \"acting.\"\\n\\nNatalie Portman is similarly awful as Padme Amidala. While I greatly enjoyed her performances in \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\", she is totally out of her element here. She seems to have adopted Carrie Fisher\\'s knack for \"on again, off again\" British accents and constantly changing her approach to the character.\\n\\nEwan McGregor is simply boring as Obi Wan Kenobi in \"The Phantom Menace\" with next to NO personality or even desire. As Robert McKee from Adaptation says, \"You cannot have a protagonist without desire, it doesn\\'t make any SENSE!\" Granted, like Portman he would vastly improve in \"Attack of the Clones\", but in \"The Phantom Menace\" he\\'s merely a blank slate.\\n\\nIf you thought the tonal shifts in \"Return of the Jedi\" were jarring and awful, \"The Phantom Menace\" will all but drive you insane. One minute you\\'ll have very serious, intellectual discussion of the Republic debating how to deal with an ominous trade blockade or Darth Maul brooding alongside his evil master Darth Sidious, and the next minute you\\'ll have Jar Jar stepping in crap and smelling Eopie farts. It makes immersion into the film almost impossible.\\n\\nWith all that being said though, the film does enough right for me to BARELY consider it good. The introduction of complex world politics to the universe of \"Star Wars\" is refreshing and fascinating. I love seeing how the Republic works in terms of its government and decision making, and kudos to Lucas for giving the bad guys more of a complex and realistic plan than merely blowing up planets with a giant laser.\\n\\nLiam Neeson is outstanding as Qui Gonn Jinn, a character so fascinating and with so much depth that it makes me even more frustrated with how poorly his original trilogy equivalent Ben Kenobi was written in \"A New Hope.\" He has the wisdom and stoicism you\\'d expect, but his rebellious, chaotic \"ends justify the means\" approach to solving problems is surprising and makes for a more interesting mentor figure. At the same time, he is incredibly empathetic and loyal to those close to him, seeing the value in those who may not even see it in themselves. Neeson does an excellent job balancing Qui Gonn\\'s warmth, wisdom, passion and intensity in a very nuanced performance that is easily the best in the movie. Not often do we have anti-establishment mentors in science fantasy, and when we do it\\'s rarely as subtle as with Qui Gonn in \"Episode I.\" Thus when he loses his life at the hands of the demonic Darth Maul in the film\\'s climactic lightsaber duel, it truly stung me emotionally. It\\'s a vast improvement over Ben Kenobi\\'s emotionally barren death in \"A New Hope.\"\\n\\nWhile the jarring shifts in tone may be distracting, the film does at least touch on some clever themes. The idea and message of symbiosis (Multiple organisms working together for mutual benefit) is consistent throughout the movie through its characters and relationships as well as the concept of the symbiotic midichlorians; microscopic organisms that represent Jedi\\'s connection to the Force. Many critics have pointed out that midichlorians remove the mysticism behind the Force, but perhaps we\\'re looking at it from the wrong view. Perhaps midichlorians are created through force of will and faith, rather merely existing immediately upon birth regardless of will. It\\'s at the very least a thought provoking concept.\\n\\nPeople have gone all out on their criticism of \"The Phantom Menace.\" They\\'re throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this movie. I can\\'t change your opinion on the film whatever it is, and I wouldn\\'t want too. I merely ask one thing; I want you to ask yourself, is not liking this movie reason enough to call it \"one of the worst movies ever made?\" ', '6']\n",

Jar Jar Binks and the underwater kingdom, the cool destroyer droids, the energy shields, Darth Maul, Naboo and its breathtaking architecture. I was fascinated by this fantasy world, to the point I started to like the new saga much more than the old one. Episode IV, V and VI seemed boring and far more unimaginative.

At the time, there was an early website entitled Jar Jar Must Die. I concur, he does great damage to the movie. In Lucas\\' defense, the darkness of Darth Maul, who truly made Dooku look like a girl scout, is why he is trying to balance like he did in Jedi. Also, The wooden acting which reaches the nadir with Shmi. There are good touches here, Neeson\\'s Qui Gon makes you wish they hadn\\'t killed him off so early in the prequels. Watto is an effective character that is well drawn and entertaining. I own this movie for the best light-saber duel found in any Star Wars movie. SPOILER: Fans need to realize how groundbreaking it was for a Jedi to be killed so brutally on film. When I saw this there was a loud gasp, yes, Kenobi was killed in New Hope but he vanished into the Force mystically. Qui Gon is not quite so fortunate, the brutality of the duel with many nasty kicks and punches, interspersed with Obi Wan being thrown off of a landing, please, compare this with any of the duels in the originals? Even the duels in Clones or Sith are nothing on this level for speed and well done fighting. I like the Qui Gon part of the duel but the one between Kenobi and Maul is why I own this. It fills in the legend that was Kenobi, spoken of in New Hope, but when we meet him then he is an old geezer.\\n\\nDarth Maul holds the movie together for those of us who like it. Admittedly, it is far from the best Sith, but also commensurately above the,\"I am in pain, please tell me if you are suffering also?\" Yes, Anakin we are in great pain but not from your love for Padme. There is this sense of foreboding about Anakin that is rendered well. My favorite scene is where Shmi is looking at her boy from a distance with a look of fear. The foreshadowing of the monster with the Jedi Council picking up right away there is something quite dangerous about this innocuous looking little boy. Williams\\' score is the best of the three by a country mile with the classic Duel Of The Fates. The music with the best duel of all six movies, for me, redeems its many deficiencies. Lloyd does a capable job, for one so young, of a sinister little boy with a over-consuming temper, a harbinger of what is to come. What always killed these prequel movies is that we already knew the ending before even viewing the movies. Also, the original had become a thing of cinematic legend that it was impossible to live up to. The casting in the original, besides Ford / Guiness, was not a thing of legend. Ever seen Hamill in other movies? Carrie Fisher? Yes, detractors, Christenson was chosen for his physical resemblance to Vader but his acting was always the weak point of this trilogy.\\n\\nPortman is much better but Lucas shows you that he always was renowned for getting bad performances out of good actors. If you going to buy these, buy Sith first then this one and Clones last. I saw this four times, Clones twice and Sith three times, I won\\'t lie to you, I often got up for popcorn during the Naboo Invasion part. It is not a short duel, Lucas does what he did in Jedi, he has three attacks all going at once. If you want to confirm the direction is bad look at Samuel Jackson, a great actor. Notice how wooden he is here? The original cast complained about Lucas doing one or two takes, it always shows. Yet, for all of its flaws, the movie towers over Clones with an exciting pod race and the best of the light-saber duels. Maul is truly creepy, there is still a move afoot to have him back somehow. Qui Gon\\'s defiance of the Council is always adumbrated as what led to his fatal overconfidence both in his abilities and his brainless faith in Anakin being benign and not malignant. When you watch it over, Lucas has Shmi often glancing with deep worry at Anakin. Yes, fellow critics, wooden acting, Jar Jar and some truly bad casting choices. For all of its failings, I watch this duel over and over. It is simply the most intense, brutal and violent of any of the light-saber battles.

Their appearances, the ways of fighting, and characters are differ from each one. I think this is because not only attract audience, but also make the hardships for Jedies.

This movie took into account what the original movies lacked. There was more action, which for the most part was great. Also, we finally get to see a closer look at some of the less known planets, some of which we had seen only a glimpse of at the end of \"Return of the Jedi\". There are though a couple a huge problems the movie did have, that would have put off many people who aren\\'t big fans. One of which is how fast paced parts of the movie were, parts of the movie that I would have loved to be longer were cut short, and plenty of amazing areas are not well focused on. Another thing is that Obi-Wan plays only a small role in the movie, acting as more as Qui-Gons side kick, which for any fan would be bothersome. Also Qui-Gon is never really fully explained, and at the end, you kind of end up wishing that he was not put in, or that more was known about him to make the last major fight scene more dramatic.

I\\'m almost baffled that none of the actors in this movie have committed suicide yet. I know I probably would if I knew I were responsible for a disaster such as this.\\n\\nLet\\'s list the good things first. The casting of Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi. The score by John Williams. Darth Maul. Gui-Gon\\'s line about the ability to speak not making one intelligent. And that\\'s about it.\\n\\nFirst of all, the characters. Never in this film is there an attempt at developing any of the characters, or make them compelling. They show little to no emotion at all and they only do what they\\'re told, or supposed to do. And don\\'t even get me started on Jar Jar Jinx. Or is it Binks? Who cares.\\n\\nThe look of this movie isn\\'t all that great either. Right now it\\'s 2016 and the CGI of this movie is horribly dated. How unfortunate that a movie that came out 39 years ago looks so much better than one that came out 17 years ago. Why did it have to look so colorless and dry? The direction, the camera-work, the editing is impossibly stale and dull. Then there\\'s the acting, which is not very impressive either. And the dialogue? The dialogue of this movie is at the same time unmemorable and cringeworthy. Did Lucas not know how people interact in real life or what?\\n\\nAnd the pacing, my god the pacing! The movie starts and it spends 30 minutes randomly moving characters from one location to the next. Then the movie completely stops, and for literally 45 minutes we see characters talking and talking. Somewhere in those three quarters we see the pod racing sequence which does look kind of cool, until it drags on for too long. Then 15 minutes of discussions of politics, taxation and trade routes. You know, what we all wanted to see in a Star Wars movie! Finally we have the most complicated ending ever. It spontaneously cuts between four things happening at four different places. The only one of them that\\'s remotely interesting is the lightsaber battle and that\\'s mostly because of the Duel of the Fates song (which is awesome). Then the credits roll and I\\'m left with a feeling that\\'s a mix of relief, anger and horror.\\n\\nOverall, \"The Phantom Menace\" is one of the worst films in cinematic history, not just because of it\\'s extremely poor quality in terms of filmmaking, but because of it\\'s impact on us as an audience.

            "643 ) ['When I first heard the critics talking about the Star Wars prequels, giving me reasons to not watch them (Jar Jar being the major reason). The only other thing that kept me from seeing this movie was that I had once seen about half of it as a kid and was utterly bored by it. But when I finally saw all the prequels (starting with this one) I found that many of the critics were right in both the good and the bad.\\n\\nThis one is about discovering young Anakin, and dealing with politics in a galaxy far far away that make no sense and I care nothing about, because it\\'s Star Wars. I don\\'t want to watch a Star Wars movie where politics makes up about 65% of the movie, which is what happens in Phantom Menace. It bored me as a kid and confuses me as an adult.\\n\\nBut alright, if politics is so boring to the kids, how about putting in lots of comedy. That\\'s the movie\\'s problem, it\\'s either too boring or too obnoxious. Boring includes the politics and the uninteresting acting from pretty much all the cast members, except for Jar Jar. Oh man where do I start on what\\'s wrong with this character? 1) He exists only to get a giggle from the kids with all the poop jokes and getting into trouble 2) His voice was interesting for a while, but then it started to get grating 3) He gets into trouble and everybody else into trouble, why does anybody bother to keep him? 4) Lucas described him as the Chewbacca of the prequels, isn\\'t that a laugh? 5) I know everybody says he\\'s a racist stereotype, but I find him too annoying to notice anything racially insensitive, he\\'s that bad.\\n\\nAlso, while I like the idea of Anakin being a powerful kid, I seriously wish it was it explored a little more. It was not given enough time, thanks to Jar Jar and politics. If it explored his character a little more I might have become more invested other than just \"Oh he can fix machines\" \"Oh, he bears the Force in his blood\". It might have even made the child actor\\'s performance less bland and monotoned. The kid, while may have done better in other movies, does not work out well here at all. Partly because the writing is so hokey and bad, but also because Lucas didn\\'t try hard enough with him in tone. I believe Liam Neeson\\'s character is alive more than I believe Jake Llyod\\'s because this movie did not give Anakin enough room to breathe.\\n\\nThere were other times I questioned what movie I really was watching: Some of the worlds looked a little too modern, like the Jedi planet (forgot the name). It looked much more like a technologically advanced version of New York City. Also, the pod racing has TV announcers. Speaking of which, while the pod racing is cool, I probably would have liked it better if I had not seen Ben Hur with the amazing chariot racing. What also bothers me about it is when you think \"Star Wars\" is pod racing really what comes to mind or is it lightsaber duels? Well thankfully, we do get about twenty minutes worth of a lightsaber fight total in the entire movie. There should have been more honestly, but the best fight scene is Darth Maul vs Obi Wan and Qui Gon. The music accompaniment and the cool choreographed fight still puts me at the edge of my seat, even though I know who\\'s coming out alive. I would have liked to have seen more of Darth Maul, his motivation, where he came from, and see him do more evil under his master\\'s training. We got that from Darth Vader in the original trilogy, why couldn\\'t we see more of Darth Maul? It would be a lot better than sticking around with Jar Jar.\\n\\nFor me, the Darth Maul fight sequence was the only thing that felt like a genuine Star Wars moment. The rest was too boring for me to care about, or just too annoying. The acting was dull, there was too much politics, too much Jar Jar, and I still wonder how nobody figures out that Palpatine\\'s the Sith Lord.

It may even be considered that, if the first trilogy was the story of Luke Skywalker, the second is the story of Darth Vader. In this film, directed and written by George Lucas, has the participation of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ian McDiarmid, among other actors.\\n\\nThis is a film that seeks to begin a new trilogy but that's full of failures, with a single guilty: George Lucas. He made the script and the direction, but he seems so concerned about action and special effects that forgot everything else. The script is reasonable, the connection he makes with the previous films, although remote, is credible. However, it gives too much importance to things that don't matter (as the race where Anakin participates) and ignore events that, if they had been developed, would have made the film more interesting. This is the case of the Naboo's invasion, which should have been more dramatic, and Luke chose to observe coolly, from the Amidala's palace windows. Another flaw is the character's design. Lucas took all the emotional and psychological side, emptying them. There are even certain characters that shouldn't exist because they have no relevance, as Sebulba, a poor attempt to create a villain which is never threatening. The passion of Amidala and Anakin, who should have been intense and overwhelming, hardly goes beyond the exchange of glances, prudish and restrained, unable to move the audience. Its a film with plenty of action, but a huge emotional shyness, unable to make the audience shed a tear. The public sees and appreciates, but isn't attached to the characters. The most notable exception is Jar Jar, a humorous and well developed character, making the audience love him or hate him and leaving anyone indifferent. So, if by some chance the actors didn't seem to be particularly inspired in this film, we can blame Luke, as the actors did what was asked of them.\\n\\nAction scenes and special effects deserve applause and are, truly, the great strong point of the film. The new technologies have enabled to make wonders apparently unbelievable at the time of the first film. The costumes, characterization and scenarios also deserve congratulations. The soundtrack wasn't particularly great but the editing and sound effects were at the highest level, leading to the Oscar nomination for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects and Best Visual Effects. \", '7']\n",

Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan encounter Gungan outcast Jar Jar Binks on Naboo. They rescue Queen Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman). Their ship is forced to land on the planet Tatooine where they meet slave child Anakin Skywalker.\\n\\nThe general assessment is that this is a CGI masterpiece but there are many problems. Even its' biggest detractors can't deny that this movie has revolutionary CGI. It is a wonderland of computer magic. On the other hand, the acting is pretty bad even without Jar Jar. The exception is Liam Neeson. The man is an acting beast. Ewan McGregor is fine but Natalie Portman is lost. I have nothing against Jake Lloyd. The kid is expected to be too much and he can't deliver.\\n\\nJar Jar is horrible. The Gungan leader is even worst. It is a poor gamble from the start but then it gets worst. The kiddie humor is all Lucas and it's all bad. Lucas has absolute power and he uses it to aim this at the younglings. Even in the terrific pod race, the kiddie humor infects the thrills. The humor is bad. On the opposite end, the good is the villain Darth Maul. He's a cool character. However, even that is done wrong in the end when both Darth Maul and Qui-Gon are gone from the prequels. By far, they are the best characters and Lucas sends them packing early in the prequel trilogy.\\n\\nThen there is the force. I never needed it to be explained. That's why the midi-chlorians are so awkward. None of that is needed. There is also the immaculate conception which is even more awkward. One can get inspiration from religion but Lucas shouldn't have copied from religion. There is also a general lack of tension throughout the movie. The expositions and conversations are stale.

If there are errors concerning the plot line, I apologize in advance.\\n\\nThe Star Wars franchise has opened doors for the gradual exploration of what experience the digital screen can truly bring us. Having just watched The Force Awakens after the original trilogy, I have decided to watch the prequel movies, which have garnered much criticism over the years.\\n\\nIt is easy to see why.\\n\\nIt is true that the dialogue is a bit far-fetched at times, and not brought to its full potential, particularly because it is not fully grounded and does not serve as a foundation for the world being explored. There are times when the voices of the actors seem a bit out of place in a certain scene, but it is understandably hard to act, and this may serve as the actors' personal take on their characters.\\n\\nIt is, again, understandable why so many have been disappointed by this long-awaited release back in 1999. Putting that behind, this is my first viewing of The Phantom Menace, and I would just like to say some things about this movie.\\n\\nThere are still things to look forward to, despite how sloppy the execution is. One would be the mere concept of the SW universe before Darth Vader came into being. The exploration of Anakin's origins begins in the Phantom Menace, which introduces new characters like Qui-Gon-Jinn who oversees his training in becoming a Jedi knight, and has us see characters from the original trilogy in a new light like Obi-Wan Kenobi, who is a Jedi knight-to-be here, and a C3PO being a creation of a young Anakin.\\n\\nLet's face it. No one liked Jar Jar Bink's presence on screen. Those who have watched this movie will understand why.\\n\\nThe prequels serve as an expansion to our knowledge on the Star Wars universe, providing insight on the inner workings of the Republic. Senator/Chancellor Palpatine, secretly Darth Sidious, plots to take over the systems, later coming to be known as the Emperor (in the original trilogy). Caught in it all is Queen Amidala, a queen of a democratic state who refuses to leave the fate of her people to the dispassionate Republic (or at least, what the Republic has become).\\n\\nThey barely leave an impression, but for those who fully enjoy the Star Wars universe, the prequel movies can be a treat, if you can clear your mind of all that makes it what it 'is' today.\\n\\nThe Phantom Menace is a hard movie to rate. As a movie, I would give it a 5, but to its credit, it serves well as a prequel to the Star Wars' original trilogy, and doesn't completely alienate itself from the other Star Wars films like some people say it does. It still is a Star Wars film at heart - the view's just mucked up by a few things, that's all. The experience itself I would rate a 7. I was perhaps fortunate to view the films several years after its release, and frankly, I was not expecting much from this movie. It exceeds expectations, definitely. If you embrace the world surrounding it, it doesn't become as hard to watch it as it was at first, and might even mean more to you if the chance offers itself one day.\\n\\nThus, the 6. \", '6']\n",

Some of my earliest childhood memories surround my viewings on the Phantom Menace on VHS.\\n\\nAs I got older I discovered the original trilogy and came to the realisation that they were simply better films.\\n\\nAnd as an 18 year old, the Phantom Menace does not particularly hold up.\\n\\nThe age demographic for the film, for one, is very inconsistent, as the film continuously deteriorates from trade negotiations to comic relief from a certain hated character.\\n\\nThe main problem with the Phantom Menace was George Lucas and the lack of collaboration that surrounded the production of the film. He didn\\'t understand his own source material and everything that made the original trilogy so memorable to begin with.\\n\\nThe film is devoid of a protagonist. Anakin is irrelevant and hardly integral to the plot. The two Jedi, who I will acknowledge are portrayed with great performances from Neeson and Mcgregor, have no emotional depth whatsoever.\\n\\nThe narrative is not established, with the opening crawl supposedly serving that purpose. But there is little to no intrigue or investment when the opening crawl conveys the premise of \"Taxation of trade routes to outlying star systems is in dispute\", leaving general viewers in confusion and no reason to get emotionally involved with the characters.\\n\\nThe planetary invasion on Naboo is an underwhelming premise, and nothing at the end of the film feels accomplished or defined, making this entire instalment unnecessary and irrelevant to the remainder of the trilogy.\\n\\nArguably the most controversial aspect of the film, midichlorians, ruin the significance of the force and reduces such an engaging concept to biological science with pointless exposition.\\n\\nPositive aspects? John Williams composes a phenomenal soundtrack, notably Duel of the Fates. There is more emphasis on practical imagery as opposed to II and III being mostly computer generated, as a result making this film stylistically superior.

Fine. Okay. Which, naturally, explains why Episode I charts the rise of the fearsome Empire we\\'ve already seen ravage the galaxy through... federation disputes about trade embargoes and senatorial hearings. Not that you can fault Lucas for supplanting his sci-fi with sociopolitical subtext, but his writing - wooden, but endearingly so in \\'77 - has only eroded through the years, and simply isn\\'t up to the challenge. So, the ongoing scenes of half-baked political murmurings too boring for kids and adults alike are counterbalanced with an inexcusable deluge of unbearable slapstick and excruciating racist alien stereotypes (mesa not sawwy, Jar Jar) that would have felt agonizingly antiquated during the first round of Star Wars. Yikes.\\n\\nThe upside? The Phantom Menace is still Star Wars, and even lazy, undercooked Star Wars, sometimes infuriatingly so, is still shamefully watchable, caveats and all. Lucas\\' pacing and story may be shoddy, stumbling from thinly strung together plot points with none of the breathlessly efficient urgency of A New Hope, but he\\'s cunning about knowing how to poke the nostalgia buttons when needed. There\\'s an insuppressible glee that comes from getting to say hello again to the most familiar of faces - Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt, or hearing the phrase \"Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet Anakin Skywalker\" - no matter how forced their inclusions. Episode I also benefits from Lucas\\' attention to world-building, with many visual panoramas dazzling here before his love affair with CGI led to the cluttered visual noise of Episodes II and III. It\\'s also fun as a creature feature caper, and the underwater world of the Gungans and subsequent aquatic behemoth chase are still stellar entertainment, as is the infamous pod racing sequence (even though, yes, it\\'s stupidly motivated, and too drawn out, caveat caveat). And yes, neutering the mystical, open-to-interpretation spirituality of the Force with the buzzkill of midi-chlorians is, in the words of (sigh) Jar Jar Binks, \"How wude!\" - but even this isn\\'t as theologically lugubrious (a word I had to seek out to properly do justice to this odious instance) as Anakin\\'s \\'immaculate Force conception\\'. Yeah. Forgot about that garbage, didn\\'t ya.\\n\\nBut let\\'s face it: you\\'d sit through hours of childhood-bastardizing muck if the reward was lightsabers. And they. Are still. SO COOL. In fact, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan effortlessly deflecting blaster shots back to the shooters is so awesome that even Lucas can\\'t get enough of it, pitting the Jedi against swathes of useless, irritating droids, and incepting the consequence-and-largely-thrill-free \\'CGI blob\\' fights that would grow to increasingly infect the next decade of blockbuster cinema like a sickness. But come on - Dual of the Fates? Indisputably one of the best sword fights of any kind in movie history, right down to the interlude of Qui-Gon meditating behind a force field wall midway through. But if there\\'s one single \\'Chosen One\\' to rescue Episode I from purgatory, it\\'s John Williams. Unscathed by the creative compromises surrounding him, and abetted by the phenomenal whirrs and bleeps of Ben Burtt\\'s unmatched sound design, Williams delivers 300%, crafting some of his best musical movie magic here. If the film feels at all like Star Wars, you have Williams to thank, not Lucas.\\n\\nThat said, we are given two of the franchise\\'s most abiding characters here in Qui- Gon Jin (Liam Neeson\\'s twinkly-eyed gravitas is a perfect fit for the franchise) and Darth Maul (the stunningly agile, sinister Ray Park). So, naturally, Lucas kills them both off, to make more room for Jake Lloyd, one of the most detestably monotone, whiny child actors of all time... who is supplanted by one of the most detestably monotone, whiny adult actors of all time in II and III. Thankfully, Ewan McGregor gives his most charismatic Alec Guinness impression, battling gamely with Lucas\\' atrocious dialogue and tendency to bench Obi-Wan for long stretches of film, and Natalie Portman\\'s Amidala is delightfully plucky here (and don\\'t forget to play \\'spot the Keira Knightley when they\\'re in makeup!), before being wasted in an embarrassing, mopey Twilight subplot in the following two.

It is the fourth film in George Lucas\\' Star Warrs franchise and the first chronologically. The cast includes quite a couple famous names: Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Terence Stamp, Ewan McGregor and others and they all (more or less) shine in their roles. Unfortunately, one of the major characters is played by a child actor named Jake Lloyd, who was pretty unbearable. It was so obvious how he tried so hard to be on par with all these more experienced actors and he failed miserably. The sad thing is that, despite his age, he was not new to the industry at all, had played with other stars before, so he should really know that sometimes subtlety is the key. Instead, he went full ham for most of his performance and I blame him that this has not become a better film, but also writer-director George Lucas that he did not cast a more talented kid and that he did not tell Lloyd to lay low.\\n\\nThis pretty long film here (135 minutes) was nominated for 3 Academy awards, but lost all of them to \"The Matrix\". This pretty much describes the 1999 Star Wars movie perfectly. It is a good watch in terms of visuals and sound, but it is nowhere near as memorable as it could have been in terms of the story. Jar Jar Binks was the major non-human character in here and he was included solely for comedic purpose, but it was all pretty embarrassing. Maybe they should have kept him from being able to speak in the tradition of the old non-human characters. Still, there are a couple good moments in terms of the story too. I personally believe it is always brave when filmmakers are not scared of letting major characters die. It can go wrong for sure, but it also can go very right if it makes sense in the grand scheme of things.\\n\\nAs a whole, \"Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace\" certainly does not deliver in every area it attempted to, but it has its good sides too and overall, I personally thought there was more good than bad here and (apart from Lloyd), there was also no very bad luckily. Neeson and Portman brought some nice depth to their characters. McGregor was fairly forgettable unfortunately. I recommend checking this one out. It is not considerably better or worse than the old films or the new one.

I only review movies if I feel I have something to interesting and unique to say. What unique view point to do I have to give to the Star Wars prequels? - possibly the three most heavily critiqued films ever. I decided to watch all three prequels again (and hopefully for the last time) in order to get a fresh perspective on them. I believe I may have some unique points of view to offer; plus I am among the populace who is addicted to discussing every aspect of George Lucas\\' pop culture behemoth.\\n\\nDon\\'t be too surprised when I tell you I hate the prequels - big shocker right? However The Phantom Menace is the prequel I dislike the least. The major aspect I find The Phantom Menace does has going for it over the other two prequels are the aesthetics. It comes the closet to resembling the original trilogy, if still incredibly far off. The Phantom Menace was shot on film and does feature on location filming and even some practical effects here and there, so the whole thing doesn\\'t come of looking like a video game as Episodes II and III did. There is a lot of eye candy to behold, such as the locations such as the Palace of Caserta in Italy (why do you want to film everything on a green screen when beautiful places like this exist in the world?), while the costume design - not something I would normally comment on - is very pleasing to the eyes. The only two scenes in The Phantom Menace which has a little bit of that excitement that I get watching the original trilogy are the pod race and final lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul; an impressive display of acrobatics and is it\\'s not choreographed within an inch of its life like the duels in Episodes II and III. But even these few aspects of the film I do enjoy are ultimately superficial as there is no internal conflict nor am I emotional invested.\\n\\nWhat surprised me watching The Phantom Menace for the first time in a decade was just how incredibly frustrated I got. I\\'ve seen and read more reviews of this film over the years, analysing it to death and mocking every aspect of it. Watching the film again I expected to have reactions of \"yeah it sucks, what else is new\", but sitting down and watching the entire thing my brain became so numb from the never ending monotone exposition. I\\'m not even that keen on the John Williams score; it\\'s not bad by any means - far from it - but it feels too dark and moody for a Star Wars movie. As fine a piece of music as Duel of the Fates is, those booming choirs feel out of place for Star Wars. In regards to the most hated fictional character of all time, I don\\'t think Jar Jar is the absolute worst thing ever, I can at least tolerate him (if there\\'s any character in the prequel trilogy that bothers me for how ridiculous they are: its General Grievous). Plus at least he\\'s responsible for the only line from this film I like; \"The ability to talk does not you intelligent\".\\n\\nAll three prequels lack the space western elements of the original trilogy, and I recall a comment that George Lucas intended The Phantom Menace to play out like a costume drama. Perhaps it\\'s own such a direction could have worked if you know, the execution wasn\\'t total pants. I can see what Lucas was perhaps going for in the story in trying to portray the fall of a democracy; the idea of radicals using political unrest as a means of coming to power - such as the Nazis using the turmoil caused by the great depression to amass power. Perhaps the empire isn\\'t such a bad thing, it appears under their command the universe became a more interesting place. As someone who is interested in the relationship people have with popular culture, I find the most interesting aspect of The Phantom Menace is nothing in the film itself but rather its place in history. Think about it, the most anticipated movie of all time and it was a colossal let down, and this occurring during the early days of the internet.

But even the most famous saga of all time has its limits, here are my thoughts of the first episode of the Prequels.\\n\\nWhile The Phantom Menace does deliver some entertaining moments, updated visuals, and astonishing new soundtrack by the great composer John Williams; Episode I as a Star Wars movie, just lacks the dynamism of Episode IV, the depth of Episode V, and the character development of episode VI. When a prequel to a great trilogy is being planned, two thoughts could easily cross anyone\\'s mind: you either play it safe so as to keep the reputation of the fore mentioned original movies, or play it bold so as to deliver a whole new experience and add value to the franchise. The problem is, episode I does neither. It\\'s a movie that is mostly filler almost entirely brought to life by computer-generated-imagery, which, as opposed to the now memorable and iconic practical effects from the original trilogy, as a CGI based film ages, it becomes outdated and obsolete rather than classic. Late 90\\'s visual effects such as seen on this movie, just lack the character, the creativeness, the fun, and the attention to detail we were used to in the original trilogy\\'s amazing physical scenarios, costumes, and hand crafted scale models.\\n\\nThe characters seen in this movie are mostly OK, nothing that special whatsoever besides those already introduced in previous movies, but overall they\\'re what some may call \"semi-decent\". That is, for the most part. Huge exceptions will be mentioned further.\\n\\nWe\\'re firstly introduced to Qui Gonn Jin: Jedi Master, and his apprentice Obi Wan Kenobi. The dynamics and relationship between these two characters throughout the movie seem acceptable, Liam Neeson\\'s acting as Qui Gonn is in my opinion very good, he is wise and patient yet powerful, he doesn\\'t follow the code to the letter and mildly challenges the Council which add a nice \"don\\'t always play by the rules\" touch to the character. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan, is also well done. He is reckless, impatient, but obedient and loyal to his master, he is young and energetic. Everything a Jedi apprentice should be. Let\\'s continue with the main villain, the Sith Lord Darth Maul.\\n\\nAlthough costume design is amazing, it is a very unfinished, vague, superficial, uninteresting character. He appears three or four times during the entire movie adding perhaps a bit more than 30 minutes of screen time, he speaks a couple of unimportant lines, fights and then dies. Leaving the spectator with enormously unfulfilled expectations, especially if we bear in mind the villain we all loved from the original trilogy, Darth Vader. We don\\'t know where Maul comes from, why is he evil, what motivates him. We don\\'t know absolutely nothing about this character. Hence delivering a generic, dull villain to which none could sympathize to, due to almost nonexistent character development. Then there is this goofy, silly, and obvious comic-relief CGI alien, which brings close to nothing to the film. Jar Jar Binks. He is unnecessarily and forcefully made \"essential to the plot\", though he is objectively an unbearable character which could easily be replaced. One is forced to endure this absurd and less than mediocre excuse of a Star Wars creation throughout most of the movie\\'s screen time. Expendable, stupid: Enter Jar Jar Binks.\\n\\nEpisode 1 is all about unnecessarily lengthening unimportant events to painfully and obviously build up for the more fun moments. The phantom menace could and should have been nothing more than a trailer to its sequels Episode II and III. An introduction, an epilogue at the most. Almost everything we love about the Star Wars universe is barely touched or bypassed, and everything we hate seems recurrent, constantly forced into the viewer\\'s mind. i.e. the trade federation is over-explained, so is the bureaucracy in the senate, and even the Force. Yes, the awesome concept of energy that \"surrounds us, and binds us\" was degraded and mocked, by trying to explain it with \"midi-chlorians\". An intelligent microscopic life-form, which, with the proper concentration, gives its living host, the power to become a Jedi. The mysticism and depth associated with the Force in episode V was destroyed to become an arbitrary concentration of a microscopic \"sort-of-thing\" on a random boy on a random planet, randomly found by Qui Gonn Jin. Those, ladies and gentlemen, are the grandiose origins of Darth Vader. Way to go Lucasarts.\\n\\nMoreover, there are various miserably failed attempts to connect elements from the original trilogy. For instance, why does Obi Wan say in episode V that he was trained by Yoda? Why did Obi Wan say Owen didn\\'t want Luke to follow him as Anakin had? Anakin didn\\'t follow Obi-Wan and Owen hardly knew his (step) brother. Furthermore, we are somewhat acceptably introduced to R2D2, C3PO appears as well and we\\'re told it was actually built by Anakin Skywalker a.k.a Darth Vader, both needless \"links\", which just raise more questions such as: how did Obi Wan didn\\'t recognize both of the droids when they meet again further in episode IV? How come a slave 9-year-old boy built a protocol droid which speaks over 22000 languages?\\n\\nOverall, we\\'re presented an unnecessarily long movie with hardly any substance on it, with obnoxious characters, frustrating plot holes.

And the younger audience ended up being the biggest fans of the films. But 16 years later, a kids movie marketed for kids was bashed and hated by the same audience. Why? Because they were 16 years older. No longer kids. They watched the film with adult eyes that had grown accustomed to sci-fi blockbusters that came in Star Wars\\' wake. Films like the first two Terminator films, Independence Day (1996) and The Fifth Element (1997). Of course there was no way adults could enjoy \"Menace\" when it was compared to these films. It was made for their kids. The children of 1999 of course loved the film as they should have. Step back and look at the film from a child\\'s perspective and you quickly understand that Jar Jar Binks isn\\'t there to please the adults. Jake Lloyd as Anakin isn\\'t there to please the adults. The Podrace isn\\'t there to please the adults. If you take a step back and get some new perspective you see that this is the first chapter of a story. Those who say this film is unnecessary to the Star Wars saga will see that this film is the exposition and the introduction of characters. It\\'s not gonna be as exciting as a film set right in the middle of a war. You need a few boring trade disputes to trigger the much more intriguing downfall of a republic and rebellion against an empire. Yet few can argue that this episode contains one of, if not the best lightsaber duels in the entire series. And like every episode before it, it pushed the boundaries of special effects. Long before we ever saw an army of Uruk hai storm the gates if Helm\\'s Deep, an army of Gungans defending their home from and army of thousands of battle droids.\\n\\nI could go on and on, because I\\'m a nerd who cares about these things for some reason. But Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace IS a great Star Wars movie. Not a great movie. A great Star Wars movie. George Lucas created a series of film that exist apart form the rest of cinema. They are so different, they can only be compared to each other and be judged by the episodes that came before it. Adults will watch this film with critical eyes towards dialogue and character development and other \"movie measurements.\" If you wanted my review of Episode I as just a basic movie, it would be much poorer. But as the brilliant Roger Ebert observed: \"I prefer to evaluate a film on the basis of what it intends to do, not on what I think it should have done.\" The Star Wars movies intend to capture the imagination of children and the child-like spirit of adults. And by that criteria, Episode I succeeds as much as IV, V, and VI. So if you\\'ve already seen The Phantom Menace, give it another look. If you haven\\'t seen it, watch it with a child\\'s eyes. George Lucas\\' true vision for his saga will come through. Perspective is everything. ', '9']\n",

Over the years I\\'ve heard people complain about the dialogue, the story, the acting, well pretty much everything really, and I can agree with almost all of these complaints. The hype for this film back in 1999 was enormous and when the film finally released, well...\\n\\nThe whole idea of the prequel trilogy was to tell the story of Anakin Skywalker and how he went from a small boy on Tattooine to becoming Darth Vader. This whole premise sounds awesome and as a kid, I was really excited for this. I was always very interested in Darth Vader\\'s backstory so getting a whole trilogy based around that was super exciting. When I saw the Phantom Menace, all my hopes were dashed...\\n\\nWhen the evil Trade Federation organise a blockade around the peaceful planet of Naboo, jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi are sent to confront the leaders of the federation, however the leader of the federation Nute Gunray is ordered to kill the jedi knights forcing them to flee down to the planet of Naboo where they must find and warn the queen who has already been captured by the federation...\\n\\nSo this is basically the plot for the entire film, and what doesn\\'t help is the constant political discussions and the dull senate scenes. May I remind you that this film is aimed primarily at kids, what kid is gonna sit through this? I sure as hell didn\\'t, I always avoided this film because I didn\\'t want to sit through this political bullshit.\\n\\nThe underlying plot of the emperor trying to convince the queen to move for a vote of no-confidence on Chancellor Valorum so he can replace him and take emergency powers to do all his evil stuff behind the scenes and... I don\\'t really know what\\'s going on, this film does a lousy job in explaining the plot, which is a problem when you\\'re setting the foundations for a whole new trilogy.\\n\\nYou just want the plot to end so we can get to some awesome action scenes, but no we have to mess around on Tattooine for 40 minutes first. One of the big problems I have with this film is how much time it spends on Tattooing doing absolutely nothing. We meet Anakin Skywalker, the main focus of the trilogy, on this planet, and he\\'s a child-slave who... no actually that\\'s it he\\'s a child-slave, I have nothing else. This kid has no character whatsoever, he has a crush on Padme and he\\'s good a building things, we have nothing else on this kid, and yet Qui-Gon spends the next half an hour obsessing over him, taking samples and discussing exactly what he is and what his skills mean, why?\\n\\nWhen we finally leave Tattooine, Qui-Gon heads to the Jedi council to get Anakin approved for training, and the incredibly dull jedi council featuring an irritating CGI Yoda and a dull and incredibly flat Mace Windu, turn him down saying: \\'he\\'s too old\\', that\\'s it! This council is absolute crap. They do nothing, they are constantly fretting about what this blockade could mean for the jedi and yet not one of them do a god damn thing! Seriously, get off your arses and do something!\\n\\nThe climax consists of an awesome lightsaber fight, a team of separatists shooting through a castle, an underwhelming space attack on the Gunray\\'s control ship, and a ridiculous invasion from the pathetic Gunguns, Wow!\\n\\nAnakin destroys the Gunray\\'s control ship, the separatists confront Viceroy Gunray, and Darth Maul kills Qui-Gon before Obi-Wan kills Darth Maul. Obi-Wan decides to train Anakin, there\\'s a big celebration, and the credits begin rolling!\\n\\nThe lightsaber fight may be the best thing about this film, but the scenes with Anakin destroying the control ship are just daft. It\\'s not the premise as such, I think it\\'s more Jake Lloyd\\'s performance with his constant \"Woah\"s and \"Wooo\"s which get on my nerves so I can\\'t take it seriously.\\n\\nThe film\\'s acting is a major problem. I don\\'t think it\\'s the actors themselves as Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are both brilliant actors, but I feel it\\'s a combination of flat dialogue and an over- reliance on bluescreen and CGI, both of which look dreadful. The actors are usually talking to something they can\\'t see which means there\\'s no emotion in their performances because acting emotively to an empty space is quite difficult.\\n\\nAlso Lucas\\'s script is full of flat lines and uninteresting dialogue, never at any point did I find myself thinking \\'what an awesome line\\', instead I was usually thinking \\'what the hell does that actually mean?\\'.\\n\\nAnother problem with this cast is the film never uses them. Liam Neeson just walks around delivering incredibly flat lines, Ewan McGregor spends most of his time in the background, Natalie Portman is just there and Samuel L. Jackson sits in a chair fretting about stuff. Boring!\\n\\nI don\\'t think it\\'s really possible to review this film without talking about the infamous Jar Jar Binks, while I think he\\'s visually impressive, it\\'s the personality and the voice that get on my nerves. Maybe Lucas was trying to overcompensate for the endless political talk, but here we have the stereotypical, irritating cartoon character that\\'s obviously trying too hard to appeal to kids.\\n\\nSo... The Phantom Menace is the dullest of the Star Wars films and my personal least favourite. Anything cool that happens is overshadowed by something dull. Even the awesome lightsaber battles don\\'t redeem the disaster that is the Phantom Menace.\\n\\nAfter this disaster, it took three years before we got the second part of the Prequel trilogy, Attack of the Clones, would it be as bad as the first, well, fans will have you believe so...

            "668 ) ['I believe \"Every Saga Has A Beginning\" was the tag line for this installment of the Star Wars saga. In those five words you expect one of the greatest feats in motion picture history to be displayed before you, the very start of Star Wars? Wow! After 16 since Return of the Jedi, a solid addition to the saga, much like it\\'s original two predecessors, what else would you be expecting? The original trilogy was amazing in every sense of the word, so how did George Lucas, the one who created it all, manage to demolish it\\'s beginning? Well for starters, I think that this movie and it\\'s following two sequels aren\\'t bad, and I don\\'t hate them like most, I just find them to be Marjory disappointing. Firstly The Phantom Menace was over-hyped to the point of absurdity, and add nostalgia from original trilogy fans, watching this mess is understandably painful for them. It is regarded the greatest let down in cinema, and rightfully so. This movie does so much things wrong, not just from the regular missteps movies suffer from, but it\\'s overall feel and failure to emotionally connect with its disappointed audience. Speaking of story wise, if this is the prequel to the original trilogy, why are there so many glaring plot errors? Why didn\\'t Yoda train Obi-Wan, let alone Anakin, who the hell is the Emporer and why is he evil, for everything this movie did wrong, The Force Awakens did right. Utilising actors, making memorable characters, great story line, great acting, action with substance etc... Why is Obi Wan so obedient, he should be adventurous like Luke! The opening crawl sets the audience up for a bleak adventure, which is missing the fun and enjoyment of the originals. Jake Lloyd is terrible as Anakin SKYWALKER, and even though he\\'s a kid, if you\\'re a good director you can make an even better actor, Lucas is too lenient, and is instead too concerned about special effects, which is where the movie shines. But what\\'s a special effect without a story? It\\'s not to say there\\'s some cool moments in this film, not to mention cool additions to the overall universe. When Obi Wan and Qui Gon battle the droids for the first time is genuinely entertaining, Darth Maul is really cool, I don\\'t care that he didn\\'t really have a back-story, the pod race is awesome, the final duel is great though again doesn\\'t compare to the raw and gritty duel in Empire, and that\\'s about it. So many errors were made in this movie, it\\'s hard to keep track, but for whatever reason, I still enjoy the Phantom Menace, and always will... As a kid I didn\\'t know much about the story errors and other problems, and enjoyed it as much as the originals, and that tiny part of me remains. Sure it\\'s got Jar Jar Binks, whose existence in the entirety of the movie is questionable, sure Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman are dangerously under-utilized, but it\\'s a clunky movie. George Lucas didn\\'t know what he actually created, and thusly destroyed a piece of it. The movie had too many subplots and is overall incomparable to any of the original trilogy, while some characters may seem cool, they aren\\'t fleshed out enough to care about, while others aren\\'t fleshed out at all (NUTE GUNRAY). George Lucas had sixteen years to create the beginning of Star Wars, and in all that time this is what we got! The only reason I can\\'t hate this movie is because it\\'s Star Wars, and still remains enjoyable, adding cool moments to the saga, thusly I name this review the Phantom Disappointment....

            "669 ) ['Making a comparison between the first film of the original trilogy of \"Star Wars\" and the first one of the prequels is just heartbreaking. Where there was fun and wit, there are dumb, flat, B-comedy jokes. Where there were fantastic characters there are weak, poor and sometimes irritating characterizations that make you hate the new ones and even the old ones in their new guise. \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\" is easily the most disappointing film ever, considering the hype and hope that everybody had at the time to see something that could stand between the originals. I usually say that the prequels can\\'t be canon, they must be considered a fan fiction that someone started as a kid (Episode I), then continued as a frustrated emo teenager (Episode II) and ended as a disillusioned adult (Episode III). Jokes aside -if that is to be considered a joke-, it\\'s very hard for a fan to not get angry at all this mess. Story-wise, the introduction of a scientific reason behind the Force is a gigantic mistake, as it takes away all of the magic aura the concept was surrounded by. Character-wise, Ana-kid is unbearable and his final act is so random you\\'d hope you never saw it, while the others are barely easier to sympathize with, also thanks to some of the most wooden performances by otherwise good actors. The baddies in this one are most significantly represented by the honestly good looking Darth Maul, but his haunting looks are not supported by an adequate personality, which is as thin as paper. Even the music is not as good as before, consolidating my idea that John Williams perfectly molds his soundtracks on the movie, for better or for worse. Let\\'s take a breath, though, and evaluate the silver linings. The massive CGI use is still impressive, with a number of strange and imaginative creatures and vehicles (in the best Star Wars tradition), with kinda-exciting scenes where characters shut up and let the computer graphics entertain. And, fortunately, they do. So, although I hate when that happens, special effects and a little imagination on Lucas\\'s side help the otherwise messed up movie.\\n\\nYour best course with \"The Phantom Menace\" is to get excited for those great, imaginative worlds and effects and to forget the rest. 6/10 ', '6']\n",

            "670 ) ['The release of hardly any other movie was met with the same kind of anticipation and hype than the first chapter in the Star Wars Saga after sixteen years of absence: Episode I.\\n\\nOne thing most people at least agree with is the fact that the Prequel\\'s story, including Episode I\\'s, is quite a bit more complex than the story of the original films. While many claims say it turned out unsuccessfully complex, I can\\'t agree. For its insane focus on so-called wooden dialogue\", it\\'s perplexingly sad how the achievements of Episode I\\'s screenplay are publicly missed, forgotten or lightly dismissed. It\\'s as overlooked as it is to be appreciated how George Lucas managed to write a script that introduced a lot of overarching themes and developments while still telling a very basic and immediate story of people fighting for freedom. After all, there are five corresponding story lines depicted in Episode I (Palpatine\\'s rise, the Invasion and Liberation of Naboo, the Jedi\\'s mission introducing the galaxy\\'s workings, the return of the Sith, the discovery of a young boy).\\n\\nIt\\'s hardly appreciated how these story lines become one story and how they were worked out to flow into each other, giving room to multiple interesting characters and themes. Those characters are certainly treated in an unconventional way, which feels strange at first, but allows all of them to play a crucial role at some point in the film. You kind of wonder why this or that character is there until at some point of the film it becomes obvious.\\n\\nThe films main story is certainly driven by the character of Qui-Gon Jinn, who leads us through the events and gives audiences an anchor for orientation. Despite some contrary claims, this did not go on the expense of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan, after all, was allowed to grow in the wind shadow of his master. In their end fight, Obi-Wan is neither as aggressive as Maul nor as calm and Qui-Gon Jinn and when his master is killed, he almost fails by giving in to his anger and thoughts of revenge. Ultimately though, he remembered his master\\'s teaching which allows him to defeat and kill Darth Maul with Jinn\\'s weapon and become a Jedi Knight.\\n\\nWhile Qui-Gon is obviously the main driving force of the story, the story itself revolves around a young Queen who is challenged with the struggle of being peaceful and passive or going into a fight to help themselves. In her journey to find the right answer, she meets Anakin Skywalker. Looking at The Phantom Menace with the knowledge of the following two movies, it\\'s remarkable how fluent the groundwork for Anakin\\'s character played out. Anakin\\'s birth into slavery and the following strong need to be free of orders, independent of authority were obvious in both Episode II and III for one. The boy\\'s relationship with both his mother, Shmi (finally introducing the mother), and his surrogate father, Qui-Gon Jinn, is the other side and the emotional heart of the movie. The sense of family that they convey gives a maturity to the series that has been absent before. As part of that, we get to see how Anakin is deeply skilled and gifted while at the same time being confronted with the roots of his fall. Contrary to other Jedi, Anakin has been grown up with his mother and he has become attached to her. Leaving her was a big challenge and the ultimate fate of Shmi (her death with him being unable to stop it) would greatly affect Anakin\\'s action when again confronted with the need to let go (of Padme) to a great extent.\\n\\nIronically, little Anakin has become almost as hated on the internet as Jar Jar Binks. His reception in nerd culture is sad, not least because Jar Jar is a characters that\\'s supposed to teach us to respect every being because every being has its worth - even if it\\'s sometimes annoying to reach that potential and worth. Jar Jar unconsciously made the first step to bond the Naboo and the Gungans and those who believed in him, particularly Queen Amidala and Qui-Gon Jinn, were rewarded for their faith and humanity. So after being somehow irritating for more than half of the film, Jar Jar becomes important and that\\'s characteristic for the movie. You get to see its full potential and the value that it brings to the Star Wars legend once you allow yourself to let the movie unfold in its own way.\\n\\nAll of these characters do have their function in various parts of the story, filling the film\\'s epic imagery with humanity and relevance. The Phantom Menace provides us with an astonishing range of visual expression, showcasing Lucas\\'s talents and sensibilities. The many wide shots showing characters in the context of their environment and the situation the go through just as much call for attention as precise and haunting close-ups of characters like Amidala. In the middle of all this, there are numerous shot that mirror each other or can be seen as inversions of each other or variations of ideas and occurrences.\\n\\nAll old, we end up with a movie that\\'s thoroughly entertaining while still saying good things. The movie gives us an idea of how a evil man corrupts a political system and thereby harms society. It gives us an impression of the challenges that leaders are confronted with, being faced with the task to question their whole world-view. It makes it obvious how we all depend on each other (Naboo/Gungans, Jar Jar and the others, midichlorians and the people they live \"inside\"). It tells a story that highlights the value of all beings, from the skilled Jedi to the strong-willed Queen and a gifted young boy to a clumsy but good-hearted stranger.

For years, many Star Wars fans, like myself, awaited with baited breath for the return of the Force so we could learn what led to the demise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader. It starts with the Trade Federation placing an embargo on the planet, Naboo. Sent to negotiate are two Jedi Knights, Qui Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), and and young Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor). The Trade Federation tries to kill them and they flee to the planet Naboo. There, they meet Jar Jar Binks who leads them to Princess Amidalla (Natalie Portman). They flee in her spaceship which is damaged and forced to land on a desert world, Tatooine. There, they meet a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is a slave and a great pod racer. After making a few bets, Qui Gon Jinn befriends the would- be Sith Lord and gets back to the capital world, Coruscant. He takes the boy because he has strong proclivities to the Force. There, the boys meets a CGI Yoda along with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and a rising political figure, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmind). He convinces Amidalla to propose a vote of no-confidence in the Chancellor so he can use political clout to help them. Once that is done, Amidalla, Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Anakin and an annoying Jar-Jar return to Naboo for a full conflict. This movie goes from bad to worse, to more worse, to even more worse, and even more worse. The movie suffers from poor characters, weak story, poor conflict, and uneven direction. First are the characters. There is no-one for movie audiences to identify with. The Jedi are larger than life and epic, having little to no faults. There is no doubt, no longing for adventure, no fear, and no personality. Jar Jar Binks is the only one with personality, but it is annoying, ripping off all the cheesy lines from Full House while sounding like Roger Rabbit. Jake Lloyd as a young Anakin has no doubt, no fear, and actually flies a fighter in a battle. The poor dialog adds to this malaise. The story, too, is weak. At age 10, I found it easy to track the story of A New Hope, but will kids track this one? I doubt it. A bigger drawback is that special effects take precedence over the story. Lucas, now with the help of computers, places so much into the scene it takes the focus off the characters and what they are doing (or talking). And within this story there is no conflict because not only can you not identify with any of the characters, but also you don't find any hatred for the bad guys. In fact, the Battle Droids are just as cheesy and comical as Jar Jar. Finally, there is uneven direction. Lucas is not a master director. As a story board artists, and as executive producer, he shines through. This is prevalent at the climatic battle when three stories are going on and it is hard to follow. The only thing I liked was the Jedi battle with the Sith, Darth Maul, who wields a double-edged light saber. That was cool, and fun to watch. The only problems, it last about five minutes in a movie that is 130 minutes. I made a point to see the movie again, thinking I had become too cynical.

But it\\'s like trying to dig through dung to get to the diamond.Is it worth it? Maybe if you don\\'t mind the smell, so to speak. This movie starts off so slowly that you almost fall asleep. Looking aside from the Trade Federation aliens as obvious (and offensive) Asian racial stereotypes, it seems the movie is about to pick up the pace when the Federation invades Naboo, when we are smacked in the face with Jar Jar Binks, perhaps the worst creation in the history of cinema. He is so annoying you want him to die the instant he opens his mouth. Instead he leads the Jedi to the next offensive racial stereotype in the form of Boss Nass. Several supposedly \"exciting\" minutes later we are introduced to wooden Natalie Portman. Why does everyone think she is a good actress. I never thought she was good in anything before this or since.\\n\\nLong, long time after this we are introduce to Jake Lloyd as young Vader. I can\\'t believe he got this part. Watch the making off documentary. They turn down 2 kids who obviously have better acting skills. (We also meet yet another stereotype in the form of Watto.) So we have a long boring pod race with mind numbing commentary from a weird alien creature, before it\\'s off to talk politics for an hour while the Jedis\\' and the Queen\\'s story of invasion is not believed by the Senate. (They trust the Jedi to negotiate peace, but don\\'t trust them about the invasion?)\\n\\nFinally, we return to Naboo and Darth Maul makes his appearance to the Jedi and we are given the only truly thrilling part of the movie with the amazing lightsaber duel, only to have it ruined by something that happens two movies later. (See my review on Revenge of the Sith.)\\n\\nYou might still be able to defend this movie in your mind, but I have to ask, \"Who is the main Character?\" There isn\\'t one. And name me one likable protagonist in the film. You can\\'t do it. When these movies came out, I convinced myself I liked them too. (I\\'ll tell you how I found out I hated these movies in my review of Revenge of the Sith.) Really think about it. What is it you like about The Phantom Menace?

Also, I felt like the characters were never trying hard enough to actually resolve the conflicts peacefully over just waging war. Sure it\\'s more entertaining, but it wasn\\'t necessarily realistic.\\n\\nThe characters were just average. Nothing special really.

I understand if the kids aren\\'t important to the movie then sure, get some actors who don\\'t know the first thing about it because they\\'re not important.

            "690 ) [\"One thing we're all hearing on the news right now, is how a new Star Wars film is coming out. There is a lot of hype and excitement. I was wondering if there'd be anymore Star Wars after Episode 3. I even remember talking with friends back in 1999 about Lucas planning episodes 7-9. Right now, it's only to 7. When Episode 1 came out we were anticipating sequels every 3-years. So, after a 10-year hiatus another Star Wars movie is coming out, which has brought lots of excitement especially to the Star Wars fans. More excitement than when episodes 2 and 3 came out as those were anticipated movies only 3-years apart.\\n\\nSeeing all this excitement reminds me of when Star Wars Episode 1 was coming out. I'm old enough to remember back then. I seriously can't believe how long ago that time was. Back then in 1999, YouTube wasn't a website and it was harder to stream videos on the internet. There also wasn't really social media, not like today. Back then as you can see on the IMDb trivia, and I even remember my friend telling me this at the time when he was only 10. There were a lot of people who would pay a full-price for a movie just to see the Star Wars movie trailer, and they wouldn't even stay for the movie. They'd just leave after the trailer for Episode 1 was shown. It was exciting back then to think after a 16-year hiatus and starting with the later episodes, they'd start from episode 1, the beginning of the story.\\n\\nI'll tell you now, if you watch the Star Wars films in chronological order, I'm sure you'll notice they don't seem canon. Episode 1-3 we'll see canon as their trilogy along with episodes 4-6. But, the trilogies will barely seem to go together. This new film also looks more canon to episodes 4-6 considering we see Harrison Ford in it, and it looks like the Star Wars action we're familiar with. The earlier episodes of Star Wars seem newer than episodes 4-6 with higher quality special effects and where the actors in the earlier films seem like they're from the '70s-'80s as opposed to today. Also, how there are vague references to the earlier story from the later episodes, as I believe Lucas was still coming up with it.\\n\\nIn other words of watching the series in chronological order, it's not like Dragon Ball Z as fans of the show know that they started with DragonBall Z in the U.S. and people are probably less familiar with DragonBall. But, DragonBall was the earlier and original series and if you watch the earlier episodes of DragonBall, it will seem more canon to DragonBall Z than the earlier episodes of Star Wars will seem canon to the Star Wars series. Now that I'm talking about DragonBall Z, I'll mention that I think D.B.Z. is a better story than Star Wars.\\n\\nBut, what makes this 1st episode great. So, yeah there was lots of excitement for episode 1 but a lot of people are giving this movie bad reviews including here on IMDb. I have to give it a positive review, here's why? It seems like a lot of the negative reviews were because of people who disliked Jar Jar Binks, or didn't like Anakin Skywalker as a kid, and how the actor who played him has long since quit acting. Some of us think there should have been a different child actor for his part. You could look at the auditions. Even during this episode, we knew who Anakin would become as it wasn't meant to be a surprise. It seems like the actor who played Qui Gon Jin didn't like playing his part either.\\n\\nBut, what I like about this first Star Wars film is out of all of them it seems like the most innocent. I guess it's pretty innocent showing a child as a main character and a hero for the series. That being said, this movie would definitely work for younger kids, probably more than the other films as it can almost seem like the plot was written by a kid. But, not like it was poorly written. Though, some people disagree with the writing of the movie.\\n\\nAs my title says, I also feel like this film is the fastest paced one in the series. It's been awhile since I've seen a Star Wars movie and the later ones. Star Wars is a good story with good action, but I feel like a lot of them have so many Go Pee moments. Long movies that have a lot of slow scenes, and episode 3 can be a little depressing. This first movie seems like the happiest in the series.\\n\\nAnother fun memorable scene from this movie which would also make me consider it the best one is the Pod Racing scene. The other Star Wars movies seem to focus on the story and action. The Pod Racing scene was just a really well done fun scene making us see Anakin's young abilities. I thought I heard there was a video game called Pod Racing made a long time, but I haven't heard about it in such a long time.\\n\\nI also feel like this Star Wars movie would be the easiest to understand. So, while I'm not a big fan of Star Wars, I have to rank this one as the best. I know this displeases some of you who dislike this movie. But, I think it was well done and is the most fun. I give it a 9/10. \", '9']\n",

I honestly miss the old action movies where there is an actual build up to the action so that the action feels intense. The film makers of today need to realize that less is more. No good one liners. They really need to expand on the characters. Jet li was a great action star and they just made him look like a bitch in this movie. I remember when Steve Austin was great in Predator in this movie he couldn't have been more generic. And the action ...geeez I literally fast forwarded the last sequence because it was so boring. Arnold just felt and looked like a wrinkly puppet who's appearance really had no significance at all in the movie.

I got the chance to see the first one yesterday so I thought \\'why not?\\' and expected it to be better... but that was not the case.\\n\\nThe movie starts with some terrorists on a boat having a bunch of hostages and demanding money. Just when they want to start hurting the hostages, The Expendables show up killing all the terrorists and (miraculously) saving all the hostages. After this opening we meet the Expendable team in person, with the characters Barney Ross(Stallone) and Lee Christmas(Statham) being the main heroes. Stallone receives a new assignment from a man known as Church: assassinate a ruthless dictator of a South American island. Barney and Lee go together to investigate the island and with the help of the attractive rebel leader Sandra they discover the true nature of the conflict. Barney has to make the difficult choice now to just do his job or to follow his heart and help Sandra.\\n\\nOkay I know this movie is a homage to 80\\'s action movies but the \\'story\\' feels a bit to much like a 1-on-1 copy of Commando and I couldn\\'t care less about the fate of the island people. In this day and age they could do a better job portraying terrorist other then letting some dudes run around with guns and letting them speak in a foreign language. The scenes where they show the \\'bad guys\\' doing \\'bad things\\' where very boring. Also, the acting of the \"rebel leader\" Sandra was horrible and she didn\\'t come over as an leader at all, just a damsel in distress. But yeah, they wanted to go for that 80\\'s action movie feel where everything meaningful is accomplished by big strong men.\\n\\nThere are lot\\'s of big strong man in this movie, alongside Statham and Stallone. They are all standard stereo-type ex-something, exactly like the team from other action movies like Predator for example. The chemistry between the actors is decent and there are some good jokes thrown around. Statham and Stallone together works and the dialogue is not bad. I fail to see beyond the actors though, but I guess that doesn\\'t matter with a movie like this.\\n\\nMy biggest disappointment are the action scenes: to much shaky cam and to much quick cuts. There is a car chase in the movie but it is so horrible cut that you cannot follow what exactly is going on at any point. And yeah, I understand that they go for that 80\\'s feel where a couple of guys can wipe out an entire army but they push the boundaries of \\'believable action\\' a bit to far here. (bottomless magazines, the heroes don\\'t get hit when 40 guys fire upon them, huge explosions without any hero getting hurt, etc...)\\n\\nSo for me a disappointing 4 out of 10. It is watchable if your home alone and like to see some mindless action, but I think your better of firing up and old 80\\'s action classic. ', '4']\n",

Sly was on a roll with excellent sequels to both Rocky and Rambo making a strong comeback to the cinema. Then he made this and rounded up a very good cast of tough guys with Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolf Lundgren,Randy Couture and Terry Crews. The much under rated Eric Roberts is an excellent villain and Steve Austin and Gary Daniels are excellent heavies. Plus cameos from Arnold and Bruce Willis. While this film is in some ways flawed with not too much time to spend on character development and not the best dialouge, I appreciate and enjoy The Expendables regardless. The film looks great and delivers huge on action. Great shootouts, explosions, fighting with fists, knives, feet. It also is very violent and bloody along the lines of the last Rambo film. While not quite as gory or violent as Rambo, the action scenes are bigger and more over the top. The tone of the film is lighter than Rambo and has much in common with the 80's action flicks that this is in the same tradition of. However, this is an ensemble piece and plays like a modern version of The Dirty Dozen. While not as good as The Dirty Dozen, it is a breath of fresh air for me as I am not a fan of most modern action movies that rely on cgi and cast with wimpy actors. The Expendables has a very credible cast of tough actors and brings down the thunder with the firepower and gritty violence much needed in modern cinema. This is not the type of film that critics will praise, but is just what the doctor ordered in an era where the film market does not make films specifically for men anymore, The Expendables are much needed and were a shot in the arm to otherwise lame Hollywood action. Almost a decade has gone by and this holds up pretty well and is much better than the sequels. I did like the second film, but it had too much comedy and was more of an 80's action parody rather than 80's styled action film. The third film was complete garbage and a complete mess and waste of time. \", '7']\n",

The most famous star of all was Arnold Schwarzenegger and he barely appears in the film at all! I mean, I thought he'd at least appear at the end to rescue everybody.\\n\\nThat really did annoy me. Even Bruce Willis didn't have much screen time. So, this movie features a bunch of action scenes and killing in all sorts of ways.

The team is hired by a man named Mr.Church (Bruce Willis) to kill a dictator who is a fugitive from federal hands and rescue a CIA agent who has been kidnapped. Stallone really knows how to direct a very effective action movie and this is very effective, the action sequences in this movie are expertly choreographed so well that if we were to be one of the bad guys in the movie we would and should be very afraid of a team of action stars like that or as Liam Neeson put it two years earlier in \"Taken\" (2008) \"a special set of skills\". As Roger Ebert once said \"When a movie character is really working we become that character.\" Which is exactly how I felt while watching this really fun movie that is one hell of a thrill ride. The one minor problem I had was with Stallone\\'s and Dave Callaham\\'s screenplay because it doesn\\'t really explain the characters very well.

Given the premise, this was bound to be pretty much an over-the-top adrenaline rush for the average fan-boy, but with actors like Willis, Schwarzenegger and Rourke in the cast, one could understandably feel cheated by their in and out appearances in the story. It also didn't surprise me that a lot of the heavy action scenes were filmed almost entirely in the dark, a testament to how impossible it would be for a half dozen guys to take out an army. Which they did as one would expect in a film like this. For me, the best scene was when Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) took out the six dudes on the basketball court. At least that was believable.

It was good nevertheless and you gotta respect the men in the movie for it. This movie isn't about drama, so the story can feel shorthanded and the plot kind of thin. But we are not concerned with story or plot (although it has a reasonable plot), because what we want from this movie is to see the action movie heroes we grew up with kick ass! Cheesy lines? Check. One-liners? Check. Predictable plot? Check. Men with big muscles who are more concerned with action than talk? Check. Lots of shooting and explosions? Check. Fight scenes? Check. Car chase? Check. Some good acting? Check. But in some ways I feel it also came kind of short and unoriginal. The characters were mostly the archetype anti-heroes with moral issues and a dysfunctional group, it is a bit like the dynamic you see from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. But I definitely like this movie more than the 'The Avengers', since 'The Expendables' is a little more mature.\\n\\nSylvester Stallone has done a lot of action movies, often physically demanding and this movie was no exception. He suffered quite some injuries doing the stunts and in the age of 64! Most actors at that age wouldn't even do what he did. Doing scary things with Steve Austin. That I respect. Also Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren had some interesting fight scenes, although the shaky camera made it hard to see what was happening. But it was interesting to see the speedy Jet against the towering Dolph. Jason Statham showed off some skill too, as usual he looked fast and powerful. Randy Couture had some fight scenes too and although he had mostly bit parts he did not impress me any less. The guys were in pretty good shape considering their age. Terry Crews had a memorable scene, with that loud automatic shotgun of his where his character scared off Austin's character. That was funny. Mickey Rourke didn't have fight scenes but he added some delight in the scenes he had with Stallone and Statham. Anyway, I didn't like the CGI special-effects.

The cast performances aren't terrible, but nothing memorable and the cheesy dialogue certainly doesn't help. However, I found the performances a little more forgiving since these are veteran action stars we are talking about. On the bright side, the film manages to bring out the fun with it's high-kinetic action sequences, soaking the audience with intense 80s-style gun shootouts, blood and guts flying, and just enough explosions to make Michael Bay blush. The only thing that disappoints me about the action scenes is the use of CGI blood which I believe could use some improvement.\\n\\nThe Expendables has its entertaining, but perhaps nothing original. This certainly isn't one of the best of Sylvestor Stallone's works, but I think this is be pleasing for some, but definitely not all action fans.

Sylvester Stallone leads a band of bad-asses to a war torn country where they blow up everything in sight. The characters are given very little background as it becomes very clear that Stallone's ambition is not in story but in casting every famous action star within reach. It is like a lineup of near retired action stars along with a few newer faces to the genre and nobody gives a sh*t about the whole charade. As director Stallone is more interested in showing off various angles to through a knife or shoot someone. It is one thing for Stallone to round up all of these famous names but why not write them into a story worth telling. This is all bang bang pow and whatever other word they use to describe action. Besides Stallone there is a slew of ass kickers including Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others and they are all given their big chaotic action scene. Stallone plays the desperate hero who goes back into massive danger over a woman. Jet Li gets his ass kicked by Lundgren but we are given that witless conclusion where all is forgiven and Lundgren stands with that stupid grin on his face even though he tried to wrap Li's body around several solid objects. Mickey Rourke was wonderful in The Wrestler, but here he is just along for the ride with his fellow action buddies. This film is expendable in more ways than one and should be backed over by a truck.

The studio was so much behind the idea, that not only did they give Stallone a huge budget, but they also approved a sequel, before the first film was even in theaters.

In the first installment of the now billion dollar franchise, the expendables are tasked with stopping a coup on a Caribbean island. If the rival organization takes control, the island would be the largest manufacture of illegal narcotics in the world, and would be impossible to stop, enter the expendables. Sylvester Stallone may be a senior citizen now and still somewhat hard to understand, but when it comes to action movies, you'd be hard pressed to find a better leader.

Sylvester Stallone gives us what us fans have wanted for many years, and that is a film with so many great legends in one film. Sure the film isn't perfect but, if you want over the top action like we got in the 80s and 90, then this is a must watch film for everyone. This is my review of The Expendables.\\n\\nThe film was written by Sylvester Stallone and Dave Callaham. While the story and the setup isn't anything Oscar worthy, it fits a film like this perfectly. The film never needed to be flashy in the story department, and they never tried to be. Stallone is well known for over the decades for his roles in the drama genre like with the Rocky films and even the first Rambo film, First Blood. However, his action movie history is long and it is stellar. Callaham recently helped write the newest American Godzilla film but, is more known to us action fans as a writer of this Expendables franchise. The story as I said is nothing perfect but, it does sell you nicely on some of the background and build up over the film. While I wouldn't say there are any classic lines like Stallone is use to delivering in his action films, there are still some funny lines that you will be remembering. The film does drag early in the film as maybe they take the story too deep but, when the action really gears up, it is non stop until the very end. So in this department Stallone and Callaham get a nice passable grade for their writing.\\n\\nThis film was also directed by Sylvester Stallone. While over the years some have complained about the use of the so called shaky cam, I personally never once thought the action was unwatchable. While Stallone isn't known as a great action director, he really takes this film into his own, and with plenty of amazing action scenes, he shows just how his past experience has payed off. I'm a huge fan of the 80s and 90s action movies, and so many of those movies had over the top pieces of action. Well if you are like me then you will not want to pass up this film. While the start of the film is slower, from about the middle to the very end there are so many over the top action pieces that you would have thought you put in an 80s action film. While those cheesy one liners aren't as big in this film, the action is just about on the same level. Now on to the actors, or should I say legends of past action films. Of course everyone knows Stallone stars in the film but, we also get to see Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Let Li. The film as features some up and coming action stars like Steve Austin, Jason Statham, Gary Daniels, and Terry Crews. While you can easily say Lundgren or even Stallone steal the show, I must personally say that Terry Crews steals the show with his amazing scene towards the end of the film. Once you watch the film you will instantly know what I am talking about. The stars of the film are amazing together, and it is a real joy to see so many greats in one film together. Stallone gets high praise for his directing this film and for being able to bring so many of our favorites into one film.\\n\\nBrain Tyler composed the score for this film. He is the composer of all the Expendable films, and has even recently done work on bigger films such as Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. While I personally love those cheesy scores from composers of the 80s, this score from Tyler doesn't really hold up against those films, and frankly no one should have expected it to, as this is a completely different day and age with much different technology. While I can't say Tyler does a great job, his score is good enough for this amazing film.\\n\\nOverall, everyone should see this film at some point. Sure it may not be as amazing as those 80s action films but, Stallone and company give a fantastic effort, and this film should not be ignored. Huge fans of the genre have already watched this film many times over, and get excited every time a new film is released. If you haven't started watching these films yet, now is the perfect time. In my opinion, you will not regret giving this film a chance.\\n\\n8/10 \", '8']\n",

If the latest Rambo(2008) was anything to go by I knew this was going to be ace, or so I thought, well almost.\\n\\nI reviewing this with the run up to EX3 just days away from release, and thought I'd start at the start. So watching this back (with Sly both behind, and in front of the camera) its a real throwback to everyone's favourite 80's flicks, there is real sense that Sly is trying to give us a real insight into the guys in the film (especially with Sly/Mickey/Jason's character) it worked more with Rambo as Sly is the only big name in the film, where as with all the names here even the poster was struggling to fit them in, but then again non-one is watching this for an Oscar nomination as its an action fest, just how it should be.\\n\\nThe action scenes are thick, fast and brutal but arrive in batches more towards that latter part of the film. In all honestly I did like Rambo more as action was its main driving force, Sly really want to deliver some plot and it does slow the film down at times, but I think he knows that as come the second film he steps down as Director and the balance of EX2 has way more laughs, even bigger names and action. So to sum up its great start to what could be a great franchise The one distracting factor throughout this and the 2nd film is the CGI is pretty poor and Rambo for that matter I notice that Lionsgate is behind these films so makes me question if its down to them) One more thing is Ex is rated at 18, EX2 at 15 and EX3 at 12A which sounds to me the violence is going to be pretty toned down but allows more bums on the seats so only time will tell. \", '7']\n",

It's not the same as the second one, when it's JCVD; he's definitely a bigger threat who's more superior. Even the second one has a better co-villain, and that's Scott Adkins, he's a huge threat in comparison to Eric Roberts, in this one.\\n\\nI did love the film, in some ways admittedly. I mean, it had some of the biggest action-stars of all-time in it, that's a great treat for us retro-lovers and action-fans. Schwarzenegger should have had a bigger and better role in it, though.

Even in this film, he still maintains his rep, though watered down a bit. An action film with fans that hope for romance and comedy? Although the film supplies little of both (its action so what do you expect?), it provides enough to develop the characters for the storyline. To learn how to shape expectations may never be mastered. But to realize a good film given the efforts of actors and directors both despite its shortcomings is something we should be familiar with, especially since many classic films cannot be matched, merely \"redone.\" I liked this movie quite a bit and was intrigued by negative reviews and so decided to put my two cents in.

But unfortunately what could have been one of the greatest action movies of all time ended up being nothing more than a generic action with little memorability other than its cast.\\n\\nUltimately the film is centred around one gimmick. Get the biggest action stars and put them together on screen. At first the premise sounds like a good one, but the problem is that its a tough idea to get right. With so many people in one film it becomes difficult to let any of them shine as they would on a lone outing since they get quite little screen time. What would usually seem cool like machine gunning a room full of bad guys feels mundane when everyone else in the film is doing it too. Also many of the names don\\'t get much more than a cameo with both Willis and Schwarzenegger getting less than 5 minutes of screen time.\\n\\nPossibly you could make the premise work with a really good script that can juggle all the characters as films like Ocean 11 had done before it. But unfortunately Stallone was not up to the job. Unlike the action movies that made us love these stars, it has no memorable moments. He seemed more relied on the cast to make the film work than using the script to make the actors more effective. The actors do their best to bring some charm to the film and at times it can lead to some cool moments but not often.\\n\\nThe fights seem to blend together since nothing seems to happen other than a lot of explosions and endless numbers of faceless bad guys dying. Watching these fights actually bugged me to see how the actions have changed since those iconic ones of the 70\\'s and 80\\'s. Instead of the realistic blood pouches they used to use, we now only see extremely fake VFX blood splatter. This mixed with the fake gunfire draws little interest in to any of the action scenes and makes it far weaker than those classic actions that it\\'s trying to duplicate.\\n\\nPlus all of the dialogue is so dull and adds little personality to these heroes. There\\'s no \"I am the law\" or \"I\\'ll be back\" lines that will have us quoting these films for years. The best the film will give is a wink to the audience by referencing these lines instead of making its own memorable lines. The script tries to capitalise on out love of great actions instead of making one itself.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fan of any of the stars it may be worth watching as it\\'s still an OK action.

What it is is exactly what it suggests on the cover; a cracking hour and a half of explosions, fisticuffs and shoot-outs featuring an amazing ensemble of many of the 80s finest action heroes plus more recent ones like Jet Li and aforementioned Statham.\\n\\nWhile nowhere near as prolific a director as he is actor, Sylvester Stallone has nevertheless proved himself many times as extremely effective shouting 'action' as he is likewise saying 'Adrian'.\\n\\nWith previous credits including 3 of the Rocky movies, plus the Rambo remake, Stallone is no slouch when it comes to having an eye for a good action movie. He has made a career of pretending to be quite dim when the man is clearly a lot brighter than many give him credit for, and that is evident again in Expendables.\\n\\nThe story, a flimsy load of nonsense, is just a vehicle in this movie to travel from one explosive action scene to another, and quite simply it works brilliantly. The fights are bone-crunchingly satisfying, the shootouts crazily hectic and the explosions so over the top you'll smile and giggle like a kid reliving these kinds of moments from Hollywood's past.\\n\\nWhat IS surprising is the level of acting and characterisation - while in places the voice clarity is very poor, nevertheless the narrative in terms of the protagonists is actually half decent, and the viewer genuinely wants Sly and his chums to succeed. A little touch of class was casting Mickey Rourke and his brief monologue in the middle works because you buy him - we saw him in the Wrestler as a hopeless case and he achieves it here too.

I would have expected better.\\n\\nThat being said, there are a few scenes that I found pretty good. Incidentally these are the most action packed scenes of the entire movie. Go figure.\\n\\nThe first scene I liked was when Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) fly down to Vilena, an island in the Gulf of Mexico (fictional, of course). They are doing reconnaissance for a job to take out the dictator of the island. Ross and Christmas witness local soldiers terrorizing the citizens of the island and being directed by James Munroe (Eric Roberts) and Paine (Steve Austin). The best part of the whole scene is when Ross and Christmas escape the island, but end up taking out the dock area they landed their plane. The do this, Christmas first fires Browning M2 Aircraft machine guns quad-mounted into the nose of the plane. Then fuel is dumped on the dock, dousing the remaining soldiers and Munroe and Paine, Christmas then fires a M8 Flare Pistol at the dock to ignite the fuel.\\n\\nThe next scene I liked was when Christmas gets home he goes over to his girlfriend's house only to find that she, Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) is seeing another guy. Lacy explains that she only moved on because even when Christmas was home he wasn't really home, and that she really didn't know him. But the best scene for this little triangle is when Christmas goes to Lacy's house and discovers that her boyfriend, Paul (Hank Amos), has hit Lacy. Christmas and Lacy get on his motorcycle to go have a chat with Paul. Paul is playing basketball with a five or six other guys when Lacy and Christmas show up. Christmas takes out every single one of them, leaving them alive, but tells Paul that the next time he comes near Lacy and lays a hand on her he will deflate all of Paul's balls.\\n\\nThe best scene by far is the scene in which Ross and Christmas, along with the other members of their mercenary force, storm the President's Palace on Vilena. They are doing this to take out the dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), as well as Munroe and Paine. They are also trying to rescue Sandra (Giselle Itie'), General Garza's daughter. Near the end of the scene Munroe has a gun pointed at Sandra and he asks Ross why he was coming after him; Ross answers that he was coming for the girl not him, and then shoots Munroe several times before Christmas throws a knife through his chest.\\n\\nAnother great scene is the chase scene through the city the Expendables live in. I hate that the 1955 Ford 100 truck that Barney Ross was driving got destroyed, I like older vehicles like that one. The fight between Yin Yang (Jet Li) and Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) at the end of this chase scene was pretty cool.\\n\\nI think I named all the headliners. Oh wait! I forgot Bruce Willis as Church and Arnold Schwarzenegger as Trench, they weren't in the movie for very long, a total of about 7 or 8 minutes.\\n\\nAnyway, this could have been a hell of a lot better. The graphics, especially the blood splatter from gun shot wounds, was exaggerated; probably to allow for better visual effect, but it looked fake. I guess that was the point. A lot of the weapons were pretty cool. I like the weapon that Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) used. Sorry, I forgot a headliner.\\n\\nThe script was OK.

I\\'d seen a few of Schwarzenegger\\'s movies but most of them in his appeal to kids phase until I went back in the 90s and saw a few of his more popular films. Die Hard with a Vengeance was probably the only of the series that really spoke to me for a long time. So it\\'s not as if I haven\\'t seen my fair share of movies from that era but they never really did much for me as films. I never had that \"Wow that was so cool I want to do that moment.\" that a lot of filmmakers have with them. Maybe it\\'s because as a child of the 90s I spent a lot of my 80s years watching John Hughes films and the huge swath of comedies from that era.\\n\\nYet when I heard about The Expendables, I was somewhat intrigued. Despite my lack of affinity for their heyday they had never really been in the same place all at once before and so I was very interested in seeing what would happen. Not as it turns out enough interest to actually go see the film in theatres. I had enough misgivings about the film to wait until it came out on DVD to see it, and in doing so I realize that I was right. The film, like many of the era these films harken back to, just doesn\\'t have enough juice in it to sustain a whole hour much less the under 2 hours the film actually has. The characters are underdeveloped and some are basically useless plot devices, the villain is basically half-assed and under used, and the only decent story worth telling was given to a secondary character and not followed through on.\\n\\nCharisma Carpenter and Giselle Itie had the best stories to tell and yet the majority of screen time went to Stallone and his rag tag band of mercenaries who basically spent all their time standing around looking old and shooting people. You gotta do more with your characters then complain and destroy things to keep modern audiences interested and the only two ladies of the bunch provided the depth and emotional honesty necessary to make the extended action scenes work. Unfortunately depth and emotional honesty are not the point of a film like this and so they get relegated to C plot devices when the A and B plots haven\\'t been any more secured then the plan to liberate an island by blowing up a single part of it with barely any of the army which is holding it hostage inside.\\n\\nWhat made most of the 80s action movies work was the buddy cop scenario or the damsel in distress scenario, both of which are present in The Expendables but neither of which are particularly well used. You would think with this many 80s action stars in one room who have played out the stories numerous times would know a thing or two about what works and what doesn\\'t work about a film like this and insist on making it better. Stallone in particular given that he is one of the only of the group to win a Best Picture Oscar. But no, the film is a hap hazard attempt to give many of its stars who have been relegated to direct to DVD content a chance to shine on the big screen. Unfortunately they don\\'t really shine all that brightly, if at all.\\n\\nWhat do you need to turn a group of 80s action stars into Expendables? You put them in a movie together with a barely there plot and tell them to act like it\\'s 20 years ago.\\n', '3']\n",

The cast includes Stallone, Statham, Li, Austin, Crews, Couture, Rourke, Willis, Schwarzenegger, and my personal favorite Lundgren. In case you don't know who he is he is Drago from Rocky 4. I heard some people complain that the movie was stupid and had no story and point. To that I say, duh, that's not the point. This is a once in a lifetime franchise and for what it's worth it was fine.\\n\\nThis is a straight up action movie and has no other point then to see your favorite stars blow things up and kill people. The story is crazy, but who cares. I did not go see this movie for deep characters and an in-depth storyline. I saw this for the action and special effects. For an action movie, I loved it, for a movie in general, it was one of the worst I have ever seen. Stallone leads a group of mercenaries and he gets too attached to a job and he wants to return to rescue a girl. I guess the first rule of being a mercenary is not to get attached to the job. It's get in, get out, and get paid. For what it is it wasn't a terrible idea. If it had to be a story I'm glad it was this one.\\n\\nA major flaw with the move itself is the fact that it tries too hard to be a movie that it isn't. After an action packed opener they go back home and try to dig into characters and that's not necessarily a bad thing but they tried too hard. Stallone has his internal conflict and talks it over with Rourke, and that's OK, but the whole story with Statham and his girlfriend could have been cut out and replaced with him snapping necks. I don't want to see Bruce Li complain about his family that doesn't exist or Mickey Rourke being completely useless throughout the entire movie. I hated his character. All he does is ride in, be a sad old man, and give tattoos. He tells this story about an old job and how he got attached to it and I was just turned off. I wanted him out of the movie. He is an action star and should have been that. Instead he was a has-been and drags the movie along. Even Stallone looked like he was getting bored. Bruce Willis' character was OK, I wanted to see him kill people too but instead he plays the guy who assigns the job and that's it. Anybody could have played that role and he was wasted as a name to promote the movie. I was OK with Schwarzenegger's character because he was governor at the time so it made sense. I guess I should praise the real point of the movie, the action. Nothing made me happier than seeing Terry Crews mow people down with a shotgun. The car chase with Stallone, Li, and Lundgren was impressive. It had the stupid one liner but cars flipping and bullets flying are what I wanted to see. Some of these actors are getting old but the gritty hand to hand combat still held up. The explosions in the beginning were just as good as the ones at the end. Stone Cold Steve Austin is in the movie as a bad guy and he fit in surprisingly well. He played a bad guy in the WWF so he knows what he is doing. His scenes were fun to watch and he was a good addition. Overall, The Expendables was exactly what I expected. It was a battle of men and a movie for a man. If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, I hope she broke up with you on the spot. The acting was gross, he story was choppy and stupid, but that wasn't the point. When people tell me this movie was bad I laugh and ask what they expected. I expected the bloodbath that I got so I was happy. As a movie it is terrible, but as an action movie it is top notch. The Expendables gets the WillyT Bloodbath Badge. That basically means it was a good action movie.

It has a dream cast, great locations (the fictional island of Vilena was shot in Rio De Janeiro state), tons of fights, chases, stunts and explosions but for me it makes two classic blunders - the characters are all clods and the action is poorly choreographed. For a big budget film with such a prestigious international cast it looks and feels remarkably like any old Chuck Norris / Jean-Claude Van Damme / Steven Seagal action knock off. The fights, car chase in the middle and especially the big set piece storm-the-castle-and-blow-everything-up ending are all cut so fast, with little or no suspense, that it becomes just a fireworks show. None of the characters are developed and only Statham manages to add any kind of pathos or context to the action. It isn't a good sign when I find myself identifying most with backstabbing psychotic drug lord Roberts, because at least he's intelligent and has an ideology he sticks to. Criticism aside though, the movie does redeem itself with that cast; Stallone and Statham make a good double act, Li injects some much needed deadpan humour, Lundgren is agreeably over-the-top, and there are four champ wrestling/sports/martial-arts B-movie stars in Couture, Crews, Austin and Daniels. It moves along fast enough, and although there are no surprises as a park-your-brain blood-and-thunder actioner it's good fun.

The finale was just a fiery and explosive blur, which ultimately takes the intensity and the audience out of the action and feeling very detached.

The action scenes are huge, loud and fantastically violent. It blends brutally choreographed melee, explosions and gunfights, with each one of the Expendables having their fair share of the action. However, although the film is satiatingly steeped in aestheticised violence, I did find that some of the CGI violence wasn't as tangible as I'd have liked, I prefer old fashioned squibs and syrup. This is unfortunately a problem in many modern films, even in the incredibly violent 'Rambo' (2008).\\n\\nThe plot is a simple, familiar one; it follows the Expendables as they infiltrate and overthrow a Latin American dictator, with the token sinister executive thrown in there for good measure. Away from all the wanton destruction are parts that are surprisingly character driven, particularly the chemistry between Stallone and Statham, whose tough, competitive camaraderie may be somewhat cliched but certainly entertaining.\\n\\nAs the image above suggests, a terrific cast has been assembled, it includes: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Steve Austin and even cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are some notable names missing from the cast, but thankfully there's scope for a whole Expendables franchise, giving many other fan favourites an opportunity to become an Expendable. This is probably the first time that I've found myself wanting a mindless blockbuster franchise to come to fruition; with a team of cine-literate, witty writers, the possibilities are almost endless for potential sequels. Who knows, the film could even attract some heavyweight talent in the form of Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino - 'The Expendables' could add further dimensions to its celebration of masculinity!\\n\\nPerhaps my satisfaction with the film was accentuated by my low expectations coming into it, but I think I would've enjoyed it regardless of expectation; it delivered the masculine, ridiculously excessive carnage that, for me, makes it a funny, exciting break from reality - I left the film with a big smile on my face.\", '7']\n",

The story is typical but the action is top notch, a true tribute to the older action films and a true delight for any action fan. The action is fast-paced, brutal, violent, and very well choreographed.\\n\\nThe main shortcoming the film has, though, is it's lack of attention to many of it's cast member. It has a lot of famous and talented action stars, but sadly many are downplayed. Sylvester Stallone and Jason Stathom receive most of the attention as they are in more action scenes and more scenes in general. They also receive the most character development.

It took a long time to get here, to get this brief encounter made reality but better late than never.\\n\\nMade almost with the same extravagance of the 1980\\'s action flicks but not with the same greatness and effectiveness, \"The Expandables\" recycles an heavy cliched plot about good mercenaries taking down from the power a corrupt and tyrannic dictator of a South America country supported by a CIA agent (Eric Roberts) and his malign plans. But the appeal here is seeing the group\\'s member, the so-called Expendables: Stallone joins Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke, the last one playing a friend of the team but retired from all the action. Now, the other side is composed by Steve Austin, Gary Daniels (but you can\\'t barely see his face) and a few others.

Let\\'s face it: the heroes are the same but the Hollywood system has changed a lot in order to get bigger audiences and to do that they get a little bit drenched with a politically correct agenda avoiding problems with the final product and editing/censorship issues. With that I mean that \"The Expendables\" is quite controlled in terms of violence, Stallone doesn\\'t make of this such a visceral and heavy thing like \"John Rambo\" was, where half of the villains had their body parts flying around shattered by knives and machine guns. Good thing to some, but the movie isn\\'t so memorable for the action sequences (they\\'re good,being the most impactant the first guy killed in the movie, he simply disappeared after one shot fired) but it stays in the memory because of its use of humor. Gotta admire the priceless moment with Statham reciting a poetry in a bar, or Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren fights, or Li wanting to get more money for his work because he needs to pay for the school of his alleged kids.\\n\\nIt\\'s a helluva movie, proving that action heroes never lose their style while in combat and they never get old (only their faces).

The Sly Guy introduces us to the world of The Expendables, which mirrors the most innocent of sentiments which lie locked up within the depths of our heart. He wins us over in the first frame, because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him surreal, but his vulnerability which makes him endear-able. The audience falls in love with Bernie Ross because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith. It is somewhere in that journey, that you no longer root for Ross and his victory, but for Sylvester Stallone and his belief, which makes The Expendables a winner right from the opening credits.\\n\\nHis name is Ross, Barney Ross. Brought up in an unforgiving society, Ross battles the alternate evils of racial profile and scornful peers with equal focus, trying to make sense of the world that burns homes, bullies people at school and make a false show of sympathy. He goes by the doctrine of his Grandma, who taught him that there are two classes of people in the world, those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste, creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Ross carries forward in his love and faith, painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions, shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps, guides the world towards him.\\n\\nThe Expendables is appreciable because of its brilliance, acceptable for its nobility and unquestionable in its integrity. Sylvester Stallone weaves in a tale of love, faith, religion and humanity within a cinematic frame of 103 minutes pulling out a riveting and compelling human drama of innocence poised against the system, through the filtered sensibilities of a former South American prime minister, one who cannot understand the world, but love it enough to change it. The keynotes of each frame, drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence, with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Ross, Stallone succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology, making his emotions pure and though provoking, which touches the innermost chords of the heart, moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.\\n\\nThe story is filled with emotional subtexts which move at breakneck speed throughout the length of the film, constantly switching gears between the palettes of emotions. The dialogs exude class and confidence holding grip of the story yet laced with the finesse that allows for emotional drama combined with spiritual uprising, casting a satire on the entire system and its treatment of identities. The script penned by Stallone is one of par excellence, allowing the audience to blend into Ross through his smiles and tears, laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world, making it rise several notches above anything attempted in Hollywood.\\n\\nIn the end, The Expendables becomes the experience it is because of Stallone, essayed flawlessly by dream team of Hollywood Megastars. Stallone exudes the spirit of the titular Expendables in every breath and pulse of the film, putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles, towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with Ross, who reigns over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions, establishing a bond that scales beyond the arc-lights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by those others whose very presence lights up the entire rooms with just their flashing smiles. He balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Ross and his expendables form the highlights of the film, filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion, captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Jason Statham as Ross\\'s cohort delivers a matured and restrained performance while Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Mickey Rourke is exceptional as the young freedom fighter, \"Tool\" in his mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Arnold Schwarzenegger in a dazzling cameo.\\n\\nThere will always be movies that enchant us with their magic, but there will hardly be a journey that goes beyond cinematic borders to deliver the experience of a lifetime. The Expendables is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame, healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes, but there will ever be one Barney Ross, who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.\\n\\nEarlier time scales used B.C. and A.D. to mark important events. After 12th February 2010, the scales of humanity would mark the world before and after the release of The Expendables.\\n\\nMy Rating- 5/5 (Exceptional!!) ', '10']\n",

I went into the movie with as open a mind as I could, but after the first forty-five minutes I was just angry at how bad the movie really was.\\n\\nIt was at this point that Neo was reunited with Trinity after being held by the \"Frenchman\" in a sort of limbo (in this case it was a white on white on white train station.) This story line was entirely useless, especially since the conflict was resolved and served no point in the rest of the movie, except to introduce a cute little girl who is a machine, a useless program going on to live with the Oracle.

Another thing I do not understand is why the humans want to be free? The Matrix is a much better place to live than the real world, which is dark and cold and only hospitable under the ground. The people here have reverted to a new religion and to wearing horrifically unflattering clothing. Why would they choose this life of constant turmoil and darkness over the life of at least supposed happiness in the matrix?\\n\\nThe movie builds up to two climaxes, one involving Neo in the Machine City and another involving the rest of mankind in Zion. In the end there is a depressingly anti-climatic battle in Zion where lots of stuff blows up real good, and not one person shows a single emotion. It is as if the directors told each actor to choose an emotion and facial expression to go along with that emotion and to stick with it. Watch closely Morpheus and Trinity for an example of this.\\n\\nNeo ends up having to fight the billions of Agents Smiths that have taken over the Matrix. If he wins, there will be peace, if not Zion will be destroyed. Since it all comes down to this battle, then what was the point of the rest of the movie? Especially the drawn out battle scene that precedes the films second climax? It is enough to make a person mad.\\n\\nIn the end Neo of course defeats Smith in a manner that made no sense to me or my brother.

The special effects in the second two movies are not eve as impressive, especially in Revolutions (never before have I seen a more boring gun fight!)

I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here. After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax.

The siege of Zion, while good independent of the series, was a mistake. Matrix-fans demand Matrix stuff, and most of the movie wasn\\'t in the Matrix.

However, it was undoubtedly a large step in the right direction.\\n\\nTo start with the most praise-worthy aspect of \"Revolutions\", being that of visuals. From a visual standpoint this movie was amazing, the CGI was unrivaled by anything that had ever come before it. The final battle between Smith and Neo easily places itself somewhere in my three favorite cinematic sequences of all time. And the battle between the machines and humans in Zion is also jaw-dropping. From a purely visual standpoint this movie is simply the best of three (which is boasting a lot since the free-way chase in the sub par \"Reloaded\" was quite the sight itself). The CGI is probably the best in any movie ever made, a notch above \"Reloaded\", which at times felt as though it were a video game, and worlds ahead of any of the recent Star War\\'s movies.\\n\\nAnother improvement that was made upon the previous installments of the series was the music. Gone are cheesy techno theme\\'s and watered-down POD lyrics. Instead we get to feast upon more gospel and, dare I say, epic themed musical backgrounds. Epic, as it would turn out, is the word that could best describe the feel of this final Matrix chapter, the entire time you feel as though you are engaged in something epic and important.\\n\\nThe acting is right back where it should have been in the second one, as all characters are portrayed better by their respective actors/actresses. Fishburne provides us with probably his strongest performance of the three, he is in a the role of a more emotional Morpheus then we have seen before. And it certainly turns out to be a role that he seems comfortable in. Reeves and Moss also both seem to be right back in their acting grooves (this is of course assuming Keanu ever had one). Also, Agent Smith definitely is the strongest character in this movie, the acting is right-on and the character is developed to completely new heights as true sadistic colors come out completely for the viewer to enjoy.\\n\\nThe only complaints that can be made are about the over done philisophical conversations and the movie\\'s open ended conclusion. \"Revolutions\" at times feels as though it is trying too hard to be intellectual. Impending death does not need to make everybody do their best Plato impersonations. And in the end you may feel as though the movie has left you as clueless as when the series first began... Then again, you may also feel as though you have figured it all out. But irregardless the future of The Matrix is left up in the air.\\n\\nIn the end, \"Revolutions\" will be hated by some people and loved by others, there will be no gray here. It is hard not to measure it up to the first Matrix, which leaves it looking slightly wanting.

For example, the \"I do this and that for LOVE\" is a recurrent theme, repeated by almost every character of the movie; yeah... that\\'s subtle. You know what\\'s another thing you can do to make it even more subtle?, maybe NOT MAKING EACH CHARACTER ON THE MOVIE REPEAT IT.\\n\\nBut, at least, this movie had a good thing: it ended.

I have only this theory: When the Wachowski Brothers did the Matrix, it was their first big budget movie and so they couldn't do what they want. The studio gave a mediocre script to a script doctor who rewrote the matrix into a superb modern action tale. And now, as the matrix was a blast, the wachowskis got totally creative freedom and now we know... they actually suck.

I believe that you have to understand The Matrix before you watch Reloaded, and you have to understand (as best you can) Reloaded before watching Revolutions. Those who dismissed Reloaded after a cursory glance will certainly not be able to grasp the significance of the Revolutions.\\n\\nThat said, it is certainly not a perfect film. Its weakest point is in the action rising toward the climax. There is a time, during the great battle, when we lose track of the hero\\'s personal conflict. The epic battle between man and machine is extraordinary, and unlike certain scenes in Reloaded, it didn\\'t seem to be about showing off, but there is a time where we lose the momentum of the protagonist\\'s journey. Of course, it all ties together in the end, but when the audience has to work to connect the two plot threads, it weakens the payoff.\\n\\nThe other problem that stood out was the introduction of \"Red Shirt\" characters in this film. (Fans of Star Trek know what I\\'m referring to.) These are the characters that are introduced for the sole purpose of performing an important action and then dying. However, I can\\'t really fault the Wachowskis for this, because no one has ever figured out how to handle these characters.\\n\\nUltimately, the Matrix Revolutions answers many of the questions the first two films raised, but fortunately, not all of them. It leaves some issues open for discussion, which shows that it\\'s still possible to make a film in Hollywood without using a \"Hollywood Ending.\"\\n\\nBottom line.....watch Reloaded again, and then go see Revolutions!', '9']\n",

            "918 ) ['The Matrix Revolutions was was the highest anticipated trilogy finale behind Return of the King...and by the time that Revolutions rolled around, people had grown disappointed of Reloaded while others cherished the philosophy embellished sequel...I personally am one of the latter. Here is why I enjoyed Revolutions, and why I rated Revolutions an 8/10.\\n\\nLets start with the acting...and a small but pertinent synopsis. Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo. Yes, Keanu Reeves is extraordinarily wooden for this role...but that is because he has to be. The character of Neo has lost everything by the time that the movie roles to a conclusion. Neo does not bear emotion after a certain loss during the course of the film, and the film concludes with Neo fighting himself. However, \"himself\" is represented by Hugo Weaving\\'s Agent Smith. By the time that the two clash in arguably the greatest fight scene of 2003, Neo has lost everything and has no idea that it is simply his will pushing him forward. *small spoiler* Even that does not hold through to the end. While Neo has stripped himself of everything and every emotion, Agent Smith has grown exponentially more powerful and begins to show signs of anger, and even lust for more...something that his character lacked in the timespan of the first film or even the exposition of Smith in the second. Carrie Anne-Moss\\'s Trinity, like Neo, has lost much faith in the war itself, but on the other hand, has gained so much faith for her significant other that she is willing to \"give anything and everything for him\". Carrie Anne-Moss is able to show that strong compassion for Neo without overkilling the role...this is a war mind you and its not wise to be on your knees telling your partner how much you care. Laurence Fishburne\\'s Morpheus is again the strongest and again, my favorite character in the film...although this time, his dialogue is no longer riddled with philosophical jabber and he has now been reduced to one of three captains trying to make his way home before it faces an untimely destruction.\\n\\nNow...speaking of which...we have the epic siege of Zion. A quarter million cephalopod-resembling machines are augering their way into the last free human domain...and what the audience is treated to is something that both blew us away...and at the same time, something that we expected with Reloaded\\'s over-extended action scenes. What hurts the battle is that we lose touch with Neo and Trinity over the course of a quarter hour...which leaves the audience wondering two things when the story between the pair resumes (where are they and/or who cares). the battle does give us a little insight on some lesser elaborated characters...although not enough to make us like them or care for them. Captain Mifune and Kid are the two main battle-characters...but the female Zee and her rocket-wielding partner Charra are supporters. Some people may like this while others do not...the characters don\\'t really matter during this battle...the battle matters.\\n\\nLets talk about the battle itself. It was mentioned in the first, set up in the second and shoved in our face for the finale. I saw Revolutions twice on opening day, once in an IMAX theater and I must say, there were moments when the battle scene in Revolutions made me forget that I was holding my breath...something that the war in Return of the King didn\\'t manage to do. The siege of Zion quickly becomes an exposion of live-action (very little) and CGI (13 of the 17 minutes) action where the humanistic machines of combustion engines and machine guns square off against the machinistic modules of doom that bear dozens of tentacles and lasers to boot. In a nutshell...I say that Return of the King had the best battle sequence of 2003...but only because Revolutions broke us in for it. Seeing two-hundred and fifty thousand squirming and swarming Sentinels against the seventy human-gunned walking tanks is a sight to behold. Wow, wow, wow.\\n\\nNow that the good things are aside (although I didn\\'t make much mention to the final fight scene) lets talk about what hurts Revolutions the most. Its the poorly constructed script and the characterizations within them. Morpheus (as mentioned earlier) is no longer a philosophy-spouting genius but is simply a worried and frightened captain. Neo has somehow changed slightly from the falling action of Reloaded...he now knows the questions he needs to ask the Oracle, Trinity doesn\\'t show the compassion that was felt in Reloaded...although her final scene did bring tears to my eyes, and the only character who we seem to know inside out from the last film and who has changed only because of what happened in the last film is the French Merovingian (who is my second favorite character). \"The prodigal child returns...are you here for the bounty, Seraph?\"...Agent Smith has the worst lines in the film when the excremental feces hits the fan for Neo, (\"I was standing here, right here...I\\'m supposed to say something.\"...yeah, something with a little more substance.) and the Trainman thing was a horrible waste of time that doesn\\'t really tie into the last film at all...and the script really doesn\\'t help it there. The Oracle is the only character besides Merovingian who brings continuity to this flick in terms of the script.\\n\\nAs a trilogy, only Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are more epic in size and grandeur...as a pair of sequels...Reloaded and Revolutions are great but seem disconnected from the original somehow...as its own film...Revolutions deserves the 6.3 rating given to it by IMDb.com users...by I am judging it on how well its melds into and finishes this trilogy...which it does damn well. No one can be told what the Matrix trilogy is...they have to see it for themselves...and that is the only way to fully enjoy these three as a trilogy.

No, that is not the driving force of these trilogies, but it is too end the war against the machines! We find out that Smith is Neos negative, created by the matrix to balance the equation of the programming. We find out why neo stopped those Sentinals mid air, he had touched the source when he was with the Architect and is now connected with the machine systems! What more do you want. The merovingian is a powerful program in the system, he is merely trying to destroy the oracle, (reason unknown and not necissary)and just wants to create trouble.\\n\\nThe war ends with Neo making peace and cleansing the matrix of Smith, letting him infect Neo, who now is connected directly with the machine city, and is able to delete smith.

            "937 ) ['Its been expected that many people would not appreciate the Matrix Revolution. The series doesn\\'t throw every answer in your face, therefore its probably the only major budget trilogy that requires lots of thinking to understand fully. People don\\'t really expect this sort of thing from a big budgeted, much anticipated movie, and they hype it so much, expecting the movie to turn out the way they *expect* it to be. Then when the movie takes a different approach to what people expect, then people don\\'t like it. Its not because of the movie that people say it sucks, its because of the people themselves. Its their expectations that cause it. Instead of having expectations, I accepted the storyline as it was told, and any elements of the story that people dismissed as \"loose ends that weren\\'t tied up\" are explainable if you put some thought into it and keep an open mind.\\n\\nAnyway, onto my review. Revolutions is an awesome movie that definitely takes a very different approach and has a very different feel. The first matrix was about awakening, and there was a balance of scenes in the real and matrix world. Reloaded took place mostly in the matrix, because its more or less the episode where Neo sets out on his prophesized purpose. Revolutions takes place mostly in the real world, where the events that happen in Reloaded force the humans to take up their last stand and just have a lot of faith. Just because Revolutions is not like the Matrix doesn\\'t mean its bad, it just means its different. The movie has less talkative than Reloaded, but it still gets its message across. The action is simply over the top and very pleasing to the eye, with scenes like the super brawl where Neo and Smith fight in what I can only describe as one of the most outrageous and compelling fights ever. While this fight is not as lightning fast and complex as the Burly Brawl, it defintely has a very epic feel to it, with punches and kicks being magnified and Neo and Smith made to look like two gods in human bodies in a grand showdown. I said in my Reloaded review that it didn\\'t hold back its creativity. Revolutions simply unleashes every ounce of it. The zion battle, because it takes place in the real world, does not feature any humans flying or doing fantastic feats, therefore it has a more down to earth feel. Still, it is probably the most intricate and overwhelming science fiction war scene, with, I can tell you right now, MILLIONS of sentinals flying around while the humans fight a desperate battle to hold them back. Let me tell you, if you don\\'t think to yourself \"oh sh**\" when you see the giant swarms of sentinals, you\\'re either too arrogant for your own good or there\\'s something wrong with your head. The opening club shootout, as much as it was short, was awesome. It definitely makes the lobby scene in the first matrix look average, as it has people flying around, walking on the walls, and of course, shooting. All this to tune of an awesome techno rhythm. The action scenes in Revolutions, like Reloaded, are too excellent for words and definitely transcend any action scene filmed in any other movie in terms of creativity and coolness.\\n\\nThat takes care of the action. Now the story. The story here is definitely darker and has more despair. As you will come to realize, the movie brings forth the Matrix Trilogy\\'s christian elements. One such element is the whole idea of faith. Despite having an army of sentinals coming at them, despite Neo not stopping them before they reach Zion, and despite how nobody knows what they can do other than fight a losing battle, it is ultimately faith that pushes Neo to do something about it, and it is faith that allows the people of zion to have the courage to fight. Probably the most contraversial thing about the Matrix Trilogy, now that it is concluded, is the ending. SPOILERS... At the end, Neo fools smith into copying him, but what smith doesn\\'t realize is that Neo, as the oracle explained, is essentially neo, except they\\'re the yin and yang of each other. In order for one to exist, so must the other. Thus, when Neo is copied, and ceases to exist, the balance is gone and so is Smith. I thought that idea was genius. I didn\\'t get it at first, but like I said earlier, I thought about it, and all was explained. After that, the machines stick to their end of the bargain, and really do, this time, give them a choice, and stop attacking them. The humans and machines live in the same world, and while the machines still exist, they are neutral to the humans instead of hostile. This ending, I thought, was perfect. It brings about the Yin Yang idea present with Neo and Smith. Also, if the film ended with the humans winning everything, the sun clearing up and so on, people will say it was too happy. If it ended with a downright bad ending, that would have eliminated the whole point of the movies. So whats wrong with something thats in the middle? This sort of ending was perfect and is also different, because not a lot of movies end like this, where the good guys and bad guys stop fighting and simply live out their lives independently, instead of one destroying the other. I suppose some people are asking \\'why would the machines stop attacking? Now that neo\\'s dead, why don\\'t they just forget about the whole deal and destroy zion?\" The answer is very easy. As the architect put it, \"What do you think I am, human?\"\\n\\nAll in all the Matrix is a great trilogy. People who didn\\'t understand the film and refuse to think about the ending will complain endlessly and dismiss it as typical hollywood trash, but in my opinion I doubt there\\'s ever been a major budget, hugely publicized trilogy thats had such a complex, intricate story, over the top action, and overflowing creativity. It is a terrific way to end the Matrix movies, but trust me, the story will not stop there. I gladly give this a 10/10. ', '10']\n",

Keanu Reeves is the lead character again, but he remains unable to deliver a convincing line read, and much of his dialouge, especially at the ending, is incredibly corny.

(Obi-wan dies just a little later than the others do) After all that, we are told that we should look to the future for hope. (Let us not forget the idea that we have to make a choice to do so.) The only thing that is different is that Star Wars jumps from battle to battle every few minutes and Matrix waits until one is done and then switches.\\n\\nOverall, I do think that the movie is okay.

            "945 ) ['The Matrix Revolutions marked a sorry end for one of, certainly at the beginning, the most creative; most original science fiction films running on a smart premise we\\'d seen for some time. Where smarts; intelligence and well drawn nightmarish worlds complete with engaging ideas to do with life, existence, the universe and everything was once the predominant item on the menu, all has given way in the second Matrix sequel to flurries of \"What on EARTH!?\" moments; uninvolving love stories and dull causality culminating in a stupefying Tekken inspired fight sequence between two characters. The Wachowski\\'s ideas featured in 1999\\'s The Matrix were reigned in; they were kept in check, never feeling as if they were bigger than the project itself and explored in a dramatic and thoroughly substantial manner. The Matrix Revolutions appears tired with its origins, bored even; like the cleverest student in the class whom sits at the back just not feeling up to it on the day of the big exam, and falling just a little short of the pass mark when so much more was expected of them.\\n\\nAs the piece crawled towards the end of its one hundred and twenty five odd minute run time, nearly all sense of immersement and respect for the trilogy was on the way out of the window, and I was praying their God-like Architect character would simply walk onto the screen, turn to the camera, hold up a remote control of some kind and just press a button that would make the screen go black. \"Now, we are finished.......\" he would bellow in a gruff, low, robotic tone. What we get is something just as stupid, but less amusing. Revolutions is the point The Matrix ceases to be a science fiction film about ideas complete with an initial, original vision; now rendered a dorky war-come-action film which pastes on a dull love story or two involving the leads and their supporting acts so as to try and insert a bit of heart into proceedings, amidst the gradually less and less interesting teenage orientated spectacle.\\n\\nThe war between man and machine has reached its crescendo, the ultimate showdown between flesh and blood and metal and A.I. has arrived after burning at the back on a hob throughout 2003\\'s other Matrix sequel entitled Reloaded. The eponymous hero of this now chore of a franchise, Neo (Reeves), is stuck in a strange zone of purgatory masquerading as a subway station and cannot get out to aid in the overall struggle. His mentor, love interest and cohorts in the form of the usual suspects Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity (Moss) skulk around looking for him as all sorts of different parties, in the form of programmes trussed up in human-being form, knock back nonsense banter about whatever self indulgent; self gratifying themes and subjects the Wachowski\\'s feel they need to instill into the film. One trip to an underground fetishistic themed nightclub contains a fight sequence with guns complete with a stunt that reminded me of the finale to 2001\\'s 3000 Miles to Graceland, the instance in which a guy comes spinning into view from the ceiling with dual machine guns blazing - not a good thing. Having taken two whole films to establish guns are useless in this universe, and pose little threat to those whom fight, it\\'s a wonder the characters still proceed in using them. But it\\'s all spectacle, and most probably acted as good trailer fodder.\\n\\nThere doesn\\'t seem to be much in the way of spine to Revolutions, people flit and hop from incident to incident without much clarity nor apparent reason. One is left persistently wondering where most of the supporting acts stand in their stance on the war overall, the film\\'s complete lack of a hierarchy in this world full of sides, warring existences and clashing ideologies exposing the film-makers\\' inability to go \\'better\\' after having already gone \\'bigger\\'. Where does a Frenchman and his girlfriend, of whom he seems to have forgiven for her betrayal in the last film, stand? What about the creator and aforementioned God-like character The Architect? Where does he fit into rouge Agent Smith\\'s plans, as an army of machines and their tank equivalents named Sentinels brood in their bid to destroy the human city of Zion. Does any of it matter if The Architect is able to reset everything and play God - does it matter if Zion is annihilated? Nearer the very end, a middle age black woman named The Oracle mopes her way onto screen after some prior interactions with an array of people; where did she fit into all of this and whose side was she on? Whom outranks whom? What does the train driver think of everything? Something may be grossly at stake, but none of it actually matters.\\n\\nFurther pain is inflicted onto the audience during the \\'big showdown\\', a massive fight sequence between the mechanical equivalents of a large spider hybridised with a wasp and named Sentinels with the ground troops of the humans in Zion. Here, the film\\'s shortcomings become grossly apparent in that archetypal mannequins in a young soldier out to prove himself; a General, whom comes complete with a Braveheart inspired speech to rally the troops, and the non-soldiers in the form of two women whom feel the need to take the fight to the enemy, systematically allowing the makers to make it look as if they\\'re addressing the issue of female empowerment amidst this war-zone, begin to take over as central to providing us with human characters as the spectacle moves in. Agonisingly, amidst the millions of people in Zion at the end, it\\'s the General and the grunt whom just happened to bump into one another. Small incidences like that only fuel the feeling of the film\\'s robotic, metallic and dulling temperament; where once was freshness and excitement is now occupied by the droll and incidental, and it sure is relieving to know it\\'s all over.

Whether or not you are a fan of the Matrix series the most important attribute to Revolutions is being able to understand it. No doubt the effects, albeit stunning, cannot save the Matrix, as we learned in Reloaded. This time around the acting and dialog was infinitely better, however, even these redeeming factors don't fill the gap completely. I loved this film, more than previous two - and is one of my favorites of all time, for that matter - but it's mostly accredited to the fact that I understand what happened in Revolutions. I'm not out to spoil it for anyone, but I have met more than enough of others who have seen this film and don't understand it, as well as do, to see that those who find Revolutions to be nothing but enigmatic hate the film more than all of the three. Consequently, those who have a grasp on what happened enjoyed the experience as much as I did and feel the same way I do.\\n\\nThe Wachowski brothers, perhaps, could have portrayed the finale with a little more clarity; but I find it ashame that so many have come to hate this trilogy upon seeing Revolutions. It goes to show how important it is to pay attention to the little details we sometimes disregard in such an action-oriented trilogy as the Matrix. There really is more to it.

After viewing, I realized that I missed the wrong Matrix film to skip for a long period of time.\\n\\nWhereas \"Revolutions\" does not come close to the first film in duplicating the originality of the idea, it superbly triumphs the sub-par second film by eliminating much of the philosophical mumbo-jumbo and instead focus on a plot that the average viewer has a chance to understand.\\n\\nEssentially, two things happen during the course of this film (I liken it to the Lord of the Rings series, where Frodo/Sam do their thing while the rest of Middle Earth fights Sauron): First, the city of Zion braces for (and eventually does engage) the approach machine army. The special effects in the war scenes are pretty incredible...not anything we haven\\'t seen before, but not even as close to as faky as those in \"Reloaded\". The other plot line sees Neo and Trinity traveling deep into the heart of Machine City, where Neo ultimately has his final confrontation with the seemingly unstoppable Agent Smith. That final showdown is so intense (and so awaited) that it will raise the hairs on the back of your neck!\\n\\nOverall, then, this film falls somewhere in between the originality of the first installment of the trilogy and the over-the-top sequel. Upon the conclusion of \"Revolutions\", I (and I consider myself to be an above-average viewer of science fiction) was still a bit confused as to what had exactly transpired, but not the utter sense of confusion I felt after viewing \"Reloaded\". Instead, \"Revolutions\" prompted me to check out what people were saying on the Internet, and eventually I did grasp the fundamental concept of what had happened.\\n\\nSo, if you were extremely disappointed by \"Reloaded\" and vowed to never view another Matrix film ever again, I strongly suggest that you give this one a try, as it completes the story of Neo in way that you can understand (even if it MAY take a little extra help from Internet scribes!).

To me, both are vastly inferior and have major problems. At the same time, neither are travesties, there are notable good points.\\n\\nHard to say which is the better of the two sequels, they both have similar strengths but also similar flaws with a couple of things done better or worse in the other. Generally it is a shame that after such a great first instalment that 'The Matrix Revolutions' feels largely unsatisfying.\\n\\nStarting with 'The Matrix Revolutions' good things, the film while not as imaginative as the previous film or as ground-breaking as the original still looks great. The production design is still audacious, the special effects dazzling and uber-cool, very slick editing and cinematography that's both clever and imaginative. There is an epic eeriness to the music score.\\n\\nWhile not as astonishing as previously and there is a slight overload of them (with a couple overlong), the action scenes are still very impressive and the awe factor is still there. They benefit from looking great, breathless stunts, a great sense of paranoia, energy and tension. The final battle between Neo and Smith have garnered a mixed reaction, to me it was thrilling stuff and spectacular in mood even if ending on an anti-climactic note.\\n\\nLead performances are fine. Keanu Reeves and Carrie Anne Moss are cool, Hugo Weaving is deliciously wicked and Laurence Fishburne is imposing and charismatic and doesn't take it too seriously this time even with less to do.\\n\\nOn the other hand, 'The Matrix Revolutions' is particularly crippled by its pacing and dialogue. The pacing is even more problematic here than in 'Reloaded' with the first half especially being so inert the slower and talkier parts feel stillborn.\\n\\nDialogue was not a strong suit in 'Reloaded' but it's amplified here, its endlessly and annoyingly cryptic conversations, over-wordiness, over-complicated long sentences and wallowing self-importance add to its increasingly cheesy and stilted feel.\\n\\n'The Matrix Revolutions' story often doesn't draw one in enough, with a very dull first half that makes one tempted to bail. Although the second half fares better, the sense of wonder is nowhere near as strong and it's masked by too many characters, situations and scenes that are overlong and extraneous so, along with an over-seriousness, it feels too bloated and heavy.\\n\\nWhile the leads are good enough, the rest of the acting suffers from sketchy characterisation and poor writing. The ending is abrupt and confused, leaving one with too many unanswered questions which a final film in a trilogy should not do.\\n\\nOverall, not a travesty but less than great. 5/10 Bethany Cox \", '5']\n",

Then comes the Matrix Reloaded which was not quite at the level of the original, but that was expected seeing as how great and game- changing the original was. Though Reloaded is still entertaining and there is enough to like about this film, it continues the great relationships with Neo and Trinity and we still have the same great concept. Now within the third installment and conclusion of the series The Matrix Revolutions, this film has been criticized throughout and one can see why. The film as a whole is disappointing because it does not feel as a typical Matrix film compared to the previous two. Revolutions feels more of a bland video game based film or another completely different type bland action film.\\n\\nIn the Matrix Revolutions, what is disappointing is knowing it's the finale of the series, and this is what the directors and writers came up with. There are some okay scenes but this film felt a little more mainstream and family friendly. Another reason why Revolutions is hated is because Neo isn't as focused in this film compared to the previous two. There is far too much time on the other minor characters and in the Zion levels. They simply aren't interesting and we do not care much about them. When we get to those scenes, this film drastically shifts and feels like a video game or action monster type film- and that is not what the Matrix is about. The previous two (specifically the original) were clever, suspenseful and made the viewers on their toes. In Revolutions, the suspense and build up is gone.\\n\\nThe final showdown scene with Neo and Agent Smith was decent for what it was, as it was well directed and the special effects are brought in nicely. Though it feels almost bland in a way that this was the pay- off for the entire film. We all knew Neo was going to win, as the fight was well but rather predictable.

This also seems to have a similar story pattern to Return of the Jedi. Some plot points in the movie seem useless like the bit at the start resolving the cliffhanger of Reloaded. It has no effect on the rest of the story and seems so slapped in and out of place. The new characters introduced in that part are never seen again afterwards and serve no purpose to the story. Also, many plot points seem rushed: Trinity dies (yes, I did say spoilers) and as she is a major character you would expect it to have more of an effect than what was given; after the scene it never appears to be brought up again. Some of the action seems off too- the first fight scene between Neo and Smith isn't good. There are loads of flashing lights so you can barely tell what is going on and the camera is really shaky too. Compare it to all of their other fight scenes in the trilogy and you just start to wonder what on earth went wrong there. At least their final fight was alright. Many people don't like the ending but I personally thought it was fine and probably the best way to end it; Neo's sacrifice seemed fitting and kind of gave him a new reason of being 'The One' for me which I liked. You can only really watch this movie if you've seen the other two as it is just a conclusion. There also isn't really much point of rewatching it as the point of watching it for me is to just find out the ending and not for the overall experience like the other two.

If you want to see the conclusion to the Matrix trilogy or that cliffhanger from Reloaded is really bugging you then I'd probably recommend this just to find out what happens and not for the overall experience.

This movie feels fresh and exciting because it offers us things previously unseen in the films. For the most part, this takes place in the \"real\" world, with only infrequent exertions into the computer-controlled fantasy world itself. It feels a lot stronger, gritter and harder than before because there is strong violence here, shocking bloodshed, and people really do die this time around. In many ways this makes it feel like more of an adult movie. Admittedly, things do start off a little strained. Although there is some good suspense and questioning in an isolated subway station, the action doesn\\'t pick up until we get to a major gun battle in an S&M club.\\n\\nThis battle is actually a little disappointing, although it is good to see the character Seraph return to the screen. Then we\\'re re-introduced to the slimy French villain from THE MATRIX RELOADED, and his stunningly buxom wife played by Monica Bellucci (no complaints here).

Hence, those consciousnesses, which have free will, contradict the deterministic rules.

Generally, it means more action, more explosions, more spectacle... and less brains.\\n\\nThe second sequel cure refers to the process which involves that the director or the producer (or both) becomes aware of the mistakes made in the second movie and tries to correct them by presenting a third movie that is closer in presentation to the first movie or by changing almost everything to avoid feelings of deja vu or pretension.\\n\\n\"The Matrix\" was exceptional, a real masterpiece. \"The Matrix Reloaded\" was suffering from the first sequel syndrome. But the Wachowski Brothers applied the second sequel cure and this gives \"The Matrix Revolutions\", a far more satisfying effort than its direct predecessor, without reaching the level of perfection of the original one.\\n\\nThe storyline of the third film starts immediately after the end of the second one, thus putting a contrast with the latter which began six months after the end of the first movie. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is unconscious in the real world, but his mind is elsewhere, somewhere between the Matrix and the Machine world.\\n\\nThe bad news is that the Machines are about to attack Zion (with their 250,000 sentinels) and the humans\\' chances don\\'t appear to be very high. Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are thus heading for Machine City where they hope to find a way to stop the war.\\n\\nThe Matrix series, somehow like the Star Wars saga, lies almost entirely on visual content and much less on the characters. They can be cardboard, it doesn\\'t stop the filmmakers.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t like from \"The Matrix Reloaded\" was the special effects which looked rather \\'recycled\\' and simply upgraded from the first movie. The sequences of the fight and the highway crazy chase looked interminable.\\n\\nWhat I liked from \"The Matrix Revolutions\" was the freshness brought in the treatment of the special effects and the fighting sequences. Apart from the final fight between Neo et Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), the special effects and the action sequences are almost all set in the real world. That means that the effects of bullet time and time-slicing are somehow left apart. This single fact is already a positive thing.\\n\\nI especially liked the fight between Neo et Smith (as Bane) inside the Logos ship. The climax, where Neo see a fiery Smith, is profoundly chilling and almost look like a horror film extract.\\n\\nI also appreciated the performance from Ian Bliss, who plays Bane who is possessed by Smith. Bliss is spectacular in his ways of re-creating Smith by speaking like him and by having the same facial expressions. A big cheer for him.\\n\\nBut it must also be said that Smith himself got promoted in a way of speaking. He was the main villain in the first film and only one of the main in the second one. But here, he finally completed his transition from simple villain to super-villain, a bit in the style of Lex Luthor or the numerous James Bond enemies.\\n\\nThe Battle of Zion is also of a prodigious grandeur and magnificence. The battle is long, but it is so captivating that it never becomes interminable.\\n\\nIn fact, nothing is interminable in \"The Matrix Revolutions\". Not even the final combat between Neo and Smith. Both fighters are about from the same strength and their confrontation is long. But unlike the fight between Neo and the clones in the second movie, it is not interminable. And there\\'s a reason to that: everybody knows at that moment that the upcoming battle will be the last one. So we want to see all how it\\'s going to end, regardless of the amount of time it will take. But it must be said that the Wachowski Bros. know how to make the suspense last.\\n\\nWhat sparked controversy among fans, ordinary moviegoers and film critics is the film\\'s conclusion. And in a sense, I support them. The movie\\'s ending is terribly complex, perhaps even more than the legendary final puzzle from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". But in another sense, it\\'s better that way.\\n\\nWhy? Because the conclusions from the first two movies were so simple and banal that they sadly looked like a typical ending from a Hollywood flick. The ending of the third movie (and consequently, the whole series) shows that there\\'s some creative renewal from the directors\\' part and succeeds in showing that the series remain intellectual until the very end, even if it has lost some parts previously.\\n\\nTo summarize all of this, we can take the famous phrase of the Oracle (Mary Alice): \"Everything that has a beginning has an end\" and change it for: \"Everything that is mysterious has an explication\". And like any ambiguous ending, it will become the target of many speculations by the fans of the series, thus showing that the Matrix stimulates the minds till the end.\\n\\nThere also are mystical, almost poetic moments, like that famous scene where the Logos goes over the dark clouds of the \"desert of the real\", allowing Neo and Trinity to see the real sun for the first time.\\n\\n\"The Matrix Revolutions\" mixes up the purity with the artificiality. The purity of eternal love between Neo and Trinity and the purity of the battles set in the real world. The artificiality of the special effects, of the machines and of the Matrix itself.

The thing is that not much happens in it, if you cut out the thousands of fight scenes then you'd be left with about half an hours worth of movie.

I think that the main problem with The Matrix Revolutions is that the first too films asked questions that the final one couldn't answer. Simply because these questions are ones we have asked since the dawn of time and never been able to figure out.

Since the Matrix Reloaded never made any attempt at a conclusion (even a temporary conclusion such as those found in Kill Bill or Lord of the Rings), it ended in a slump. And that's exactly where this film starts off. In fact the first half hour is the weakest of the trilogy, as the Wachowski's try to work out what feels like a recycled part of the last film, the conclusion that never was. Here, we are forced to endure another horrific encounter with the Merovingian (though thankfully, not nearly as long), a lobby scene sequence that is pathetic after the action we have seen in the first two films, a useless subplot involving the Trainman, and Neo trapped in Mobil (Limbo) station. This is weak, very weak. But once the film gets past it, it takes on a new life. And the results are fantastic. The Wachowskis, having decided that more is better should be the motto of the second Matrix, take a daring, dangerous, and entirely original way with this one. After the first half hour, there is no Matrix scene until the conclusive battle between Neo and Smith. Thus there is none of the mind-bending, gravity-defying action, either. And none of the philosophic pontificating that marred the second film. This takes place almost entirely in the Real World, and, though a daring move, it is a successful one. The characters take on more life here. Indeed, one could even go so far as to say they do some acting. In this film, Neo and Trinity's relationship for the first time becomes something other than a plot gimmick, and there are actually moments of chemistry. Morpheus, though a side-seat driver for the entire film, gains much more humanity after his disillusionment (it also helps that there are not philosophy lectures for him to recite.) Many of the lesser characters are rendered in three-dimensions this time (the captain of the Hammer, Niobe, Link). As for the Oracle, the sudden cast change after the death of the first one for this film does not hurt it at all. In fact, this new Oracle is much more compelling than the original, and (partially because she has a much bigger role), is the one I now think of when I think of the Matrix. First prize still has to go to Hugo Weaving, who continues his transformation in the form of Smith to diabolical levels. He is exaggerated and overplayed, in a manner that is totally successful (one is reminded of Jack Nicholson). HIs twisted sense of humour is now in perfect balance with his cold, machine like evil. Also remarkable is the actor who portrays Bane, a human occupied by Smith. He renders Hugo Weaving's mannerisms so perfectly, one thinks it is Hugo Weaving in disguise (it might be, I haven't checked.) As for the action, it is amazing. The Battle for the Docks is something completely new, and absolutely terrifying. Indeed, (and as a huge Lord of the Rings fan, this is saying something), it is comparable in adrenaline-activity to the Battle of Pelennor Fields. 250,000 sentinels turn the battleground into a nightmare apocalyptic vision. As for Neo and Trinity, there quest to the Machine City is equally fascinating, showing the surface world we have only seen briefly as another nightmare. THere is even a moment of actual poetry in which, bursting above the clouds, Trinity becomes the first human in 100 years to see the sky. The Machine City itself is something like Dr. Seuss on acid, and the Deus Ex Machina is a rather scary version of the Head of Oz. As for the final apocalyptic fight between Neo and Smith, it is just that. The effects of the rain are magnificent as the two Titans clash far above the earth. And the actual conclusion to the story, something that I had no idea how the Wachowskis would bring about after the second one, is actually pretty surprising and rather clever. All this being said, there are still flaws. The battle between Smith and Neo is great until it crashes into the ground (literally), after which, the momentum is lost, and the final effect is rather awkward. There are still horrible lines, but thankfully, most of them are just one or two lines, instead of entire dialogues. The actual ending of the film leaves something to be desired, a sunset happy-go-lucky meeting that seems to come more from Harry Potter than the Matrix. But, flaws aside, this is a much better film than Reloaded, and though no where near the masterpiece of the original, is still a worthy successor. \", '8']\n",

            "994 ) [\"The Matrix Revolutions, the third part of Andy and Larry Wachowski's Matrix trilogy, fittingly ends what will be considered in the near future as one of cinema's classic trilogies. Though this third outing into the Matrix universe is the weakest of the three films, it's still an outstanding film with a great ending. Unlike part 2, this film has character development giving the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, as well as new characters Link and Niobe) something to do with their characters. Although I am disappointed that most of the film doesn't take place in the Matrix itself, if you look at the structure of the trilogy, it does make sense and I respect the Wachowskis for sticking with their vision even if they did alienate some of their core audience. Again, Don Davis' score is superb (not as good as Reloaded's score but nearly up there and definitely better than his first Matrix score). This is a fitting 7 out of 10 and a must-see, if only to see how the Matrix trilogy ends. \", '7']\n",
            "\n",
            "995 ) [\"Picking up right we left in Reloaded, the machines are about to breach upon Zion, Neo is in a mysterious coma stuck between the matrix and the real world, Zion's defenses are being prepared, and finally Bane awakens; but in a very hostile manner. When Neo awakens too, he realises that he has to confront the source of the matrix and finally confront Agent Smith if Zion and all the people to survive. While he and Trinity both go to the Machine City, the others; Morpheus, Link, Niobi and the crew of the Hammer go back to Zion to help its defenses. Inside the dock of Zion, its an all out war. The machine diggers have breached the walls and thousands of sentinels are ready to kill all its inhabitants.\\n\\nThe Matrix Revolutions is an all out action packed, visually amazing climatic conclusion to the matrix trilogy. The war of Zion is just amazing, the sentinels moving together as one being is just a sight to see. The action just keeps coming at a relentless pace. The chase of The Hammer ship being crawled over by hundreds of sentinels is also an amazing sequence. The Machine City is so detailed and has a real haunting presence with all the blue hues. The highlight of the film which everyone was waiting for is the final explosive showdown between Neo and Smith. While its a fight to remember, the only annoying part of the fight is when Neo and Smith start fighting in the sky and start flying around the place. It really took away from the intensity and over all impact of the fight.\\n\\nThe visual effects are flawless, they are just so integrated that its hard to pick faults in them. Yet they do take away from the story. All the action and effects side step the narrative, making the plotting confusing at times. The fighting has also seem to lost that nobility from the first matrix, going for more style, losing that emotional core. The acting from everyone is very good, though abit over acted in places, but overall very good from all people. One part that didn't really need explaining though was the change in actor for The Oracle. Mary Alice who took over the role when Gloria Foster sadly died. It seemed pointless that they needed to explain why she looked different, adding confusion unless you've played the matrix game.\\n\\nThe Matrix Revolutions is a great conclusion to this trilogy and will become a sci-fi classic in the years to come. \", '8']\n",
            "\n",
            "996 ) ['Is Revolutions perfect? No. Does it come close? Hell yes.\\n\\nThis film, as well as Reloaded, has copped flak from many pop-culture soaked critics as well as the masses, due to their inability to see the genius and vision that is interwoven into this trilogy. The action is in-your-face, the symbolism is deep and enchanting - if you get it, which the majority of movie-goers do not, and that\\'s the problem. One critic for Reloaded actually said, \"I want my action films dumb and stupid\" - which speaks for most of this film\\'s Western audience. I recommend observing the Philosopher Commentaries of the 10-disc set DVD\\'s mostly because they open up much of the hidden meanings of these films, and they show how 90% of the negative critics simply had no right to pass any kind of judgment.\\n\\nSee this trilogy. I can safely say that if you didn\\'t like it, then it wasn\\'t that the films were uninspired - it was just you, who wanted a spoon-feeding. ', '9']\n",

Well shame on you.\\n\\nI believe for the final installment in one of the biggest movie trilogies, Revolutions was above exceptional. The ambiance and dramatic mood throughout the movie was a wise choice by the Wachowski brothers. Many of the un-answered questions that left you cliffhanging in the second are answered. And I understand that some questions weren't answered, and for those I ask you to refer to perhaps The Aniematrix or some of the movies special features.\\n\\nThe acting is good, especially Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Morpheus (Luarence Fishburne). Other characters include Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). The action is incredible. A 20 minute war scene between the robots and the humans might possibly be the most amazing thing you'll ever see sitting in a movie theater too.\\n\\nBut seriously, this movie was over-looked and didn't deserve enough respect that it should have. The conclusion to the most famous trilogy of all time, beside LOTR, was not a let down at all. See it, it will blow you away. \", '9']\n",
            "\n",
            "998 ) ['As the trilogy came to an close, the viewers were looking for the supreme ending. An edge-breaker. A new dimension to film making so to speak. One film to rule them all, well, rule LOTR\\'s anyway! And, as a matter of fact, they got it. But did anyone take notice of it? No! Why? Simple. Because there wasn\\'t enough \"action\". Am I missing something? Fair enough, the ending has all the passion and finesse of a one legged duck holding a toilet brush. But aside from that; what was the big problem? People mostly complain about the film being rushed, and fair play to them it was. But does that mean that the storyline has suffered dramatically? The only major reason that I can think of to explain people\\'s distaste to this film is the simple fact that they do not understand it. Now, with all honesty, I too believe that the plot and tone of this film would feel more at home in an episode of a gardening show hosted by some washed up 80\\'s actor who hasn\\'t worked for years and mostly lives on a healthy diet of Big Macs and toe nail clippings. But nevertheless the story is compelling and near impossible to turn away from until you can just catch a grasp of the meaning before it is ultimately pulled away from your clutches. This is the reason why many people turn back to this film with enjoyment and love for the work put into it. It might look like The Wachowski Brothers ran through this film faster than curry and lager run through you on a Sunday morning, giving us the main reason as to why the story makes almost no sense whatsoever! But no, the reason why it is so complicated is why it is so beautiful... The reason for the bad ending is to divert us from the real questions: What really is The Matrix? Is Neo only one of a kind? Did the creator of the Matrix merely lie to Neo to catch him off guard? Do the machines really know what is going on? When a Sentinel appears on screen, why do I always have the urge to go buy some Calamari? All in all, the movie isn\\'t rushed, in fact it is cleverly designed to make us believe the uncertainties. Well, that must\\'ve made more sense than why the Oracle changes into a different person......hmm.... ', '9']\n",

            "167 )  What if you saw things that weren't there? Met people that didn't exist? Went through life not knowing what is real? Sadly, that is the case for real life doctor, John Nash. He has schizophrenia. But he doesn't know it yet. He is a brilliant mathematician who is socially awkward and doesn't like people. The few people he does like are his roommate Charles and his boss Parcher. The problem is, they may be imaginary. When his wife tells him that he has delusions, he doesn't believe it and will stop at nothing to prove that he is right. Russell Crowe plays a very convincing schizophrenic and does a great job portraying this horribly troubled doctor at various stages in his life. I love movies that are based on true stories, such as this one, and what makes them even better is if they are inspirational, such as this one. It is indeed a beautiful movie and one that demands multiple viewings. \n",

            "168 )  Sylvia Nasar does a superb job of informing readers about John Nash's struggles with schizophrenia in the biography A Beautiful Mind. Nash, a Nobel Prize winner, is an eminent mathematician with (in the words of a colleague) \"a beautiful mind.\" Unfortunately, it's also a sick mind. Although he manages to function \"normally\" these days, without the aid of medication, Nash is still a schizophrenic (who has an adult son who suffers from the same disease).As moviegoers know, Ron Howard directed the movie version of the book, starring Russell Crowe. While the film does a fine job of introducing audiences to the ins and outs of schizophrenia and the difficulties that caregivers experience while trying to assist someone afflicted with the disease, it shows only the tip of the iceberg. Anyone wanting to know more about what schizophrenia entails should read Nasar's book. It is gripping and reveals the agonies of a schizophrenic life. Thoroughly researched and effectively presented in a cohesive narrative which fully engages the attention of readers, this biography shows how Nash fell prey to the disease and how his family-first his mother and sister, and later his wife-sought to have him treated and provided with the best medical care then available. At one point that treatment called for electric shock treatment (as vividly dramatized in the movie).Nash's colleagues, many of whom had relatives who were schizophrenics or who were schizophrenics themselves, helped him time and time again, when he was at risk of becoming unemployed and/or destitute. Through sheer force of will, Nash managed to pull himself back from the brink and to pursue a life of domestic contentment and professional achievement. His is definitely a story worth knowing. And Nasar relates it in detail and comprehensively, helping readers to appreciate the horror of possibly losing such a beautiful mind. \n",

Disgruntled, I watched this movie and Oh, my Gosh! Mathematics makes so common and simple things so overwhelmingly profound. What more do you need to know that the fact that there is an infinity in between any two numbers! In fact, when you think of any two numbers, or any number for that matter, it is somewhere from the infinity between any other two... continuity is made discontinuous instantly. Jhon Nash is a figure who lives it. Alisha makes love infinite. Nash drowns and develops gills. Alisha swims in the sky. The Noble prize in the end is often seen as belittling most of Nash's so called Rough work, which must not be. Well, I hope it helps you understand that there is an infinity within everything, more so in what we feel. It's a lovely story. Russel and Jennifer are immaculate and almost seem like living it all through. The part I can't keep from mentioning is how story-writer made their romance look so perfect; it often isn't this perfect for mathematicians because their expressions are just different. \n",

            "171 )  John Nash is a quiet, introverted man. A brilliant person who doesn't quite fit in. His roommate Charles is always there to help him get through the difficult times in his life at university. Russell Crowe is, again fantastic in portraying John Nash. With Jennifer Connelly as his wife Alicia and Paul Bettany as his roommate Charles, this film sets up to be a great film about the success of a gifted person. Unfortunately that is not how things progressed. John Nash's mind leads him down a self-destructive path that neither friends or family can save him from. With espionage and government intervention around every corner it is impossible to know which way to turn. Ed Harris is excellent as Parcher, the dark government agent who, it seems, hires Nash to work at a secret government facility to help decode vital information.

Soon after, John is visited by Agent William Parcher, from the CIA, who wants to recruit him for code-breaking activities. But evidence suggests that Nash's perceptions of reality are cloudy at best as he is struggling to maintain his tenuous hold on sanity. Alicia suspects a diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia. Battling decades of illness with the loyal Alicia by his side, Nash is ultimately able to gain some control over his mental state, and eventually goes on to triumphantly win the Nobel Prize.\n",

            "173 )  Russell Crowe, playing John Nash, makes the focus of the later part of his life trying to come up with a \"truly original idea\". As he attempts to achieve this process, we watch as he struggles with relationships and interactions with other people. Having limited social grace, in a notably prestigious school such as Princeton, serves to prove as almost rewarding considering his luck at catching the attention of women. This is most especially true as he meets a beautiful girl named Alicia, Jennifer Connelly, who turns out to be his new love interest. When Nash inadvertently becomes acquainted with a man named Parcher, played by Ed Harris, the reality lines become blurred as Nash struggles to figure out whom and what is real, and what is not. In watching A Beautiful Mind, one can see the common theme is to battling our own realities. Nash makes it truly his entire focus on strengthening and using his mind for realistic and meaningful purposes. In his attempt to develop \"a truly original idea\", he becomes engulfed in his own reality and is unaware that in fact he is displaying schizophrenic tendencies. Others are engulfed in their own realities as it took many years later for anyone to recognize his need for psychiatric assistance. Associated with these episodes you can see another storyline incorporated as viewers become aware of other's reaction to what is socially acceptable of the time. Although criticism and backlash may be less harsh than our current societal tendencies, Nash suffers from stigmas throughout the rest of the film. Each character faces their own reality, and deviation from what is thought to actually exist, to what actually exists. This film similarly relates to the movie, Fight Club, where an imagination of a counterpart and friend, alter the realities of many other individuals. When Nash suddenly becomes introduced to a young student Alicia, his social limitations serve him well by giving him an endearing and mystifying quality. As the film progresses you are drawn into his secret purpose of decoding cryptography. One becomes excited at his possible discovery and chance of leaving even more social woes behind in his rise to hero status. Ironically his very worst stigma, social awkwardness, is what saves his relationships and his life, but in doing so Nash makes difficult decisions about his treatment. Finally getting close to Alicia and securing their love, allowed someone to finally focus and see an unhindered view into Nash's mind. Crowe and Connelly give suburb performances when considering the emotional state in which they must become a part of. Crowes interpretation on one's reality breaking and social awkwardness is displayed brilliantly through his jerky movements, disheveled appearance, almost vacant eyes, and sometimes mumbling dialogue. Connelly's performance of a wife trying dutifully to support her husband makes one want to break down right along beside her. When she gets angry, becomes concerned, feels lonely, the viewer feels her emotions. Her downcast eyes and her posture begin to sag with the weight of her emotions. We feel her pain and hope for her to be strong for Nash, but also hope for her happiness and freedom of safety. Two techniques I viewed at associated well with the theme were lighting and angle. Lighting was very subdued, echoing the recesses of his mind. Nash constantly focuses on the task, the goal, not the excitement of the journey and other surroundings. Various times when Nash was in Alicia's company, you can understand the change of lighting to a brighter shade as he was happier, not trapped within the limitations of his mind, enjoying the moment. Angle was also very important to the film, as many times you can see how the camera follows him and his unusual actions, or the angle cuts to how someone is socially judging his actions. In addition, many of his earlier public scenes with his schizophrenic counterparts were filmed without his other peer's taking notice, so not only they but the viewer wasn't able to immediately establish anything was wrong. Regardless of whether one believes in the process of medicine to overcome your own realities, one can safely say the definition of reality is very different for every person. \n",

            "174 )  I own the DVD of this movie and have watched it more than once. It's an outstanding cinematic work which tells well the true story of the incomparably brilliant mathematician John Nash, a schizophrenic who leads a very traumatic life, due to the fact that overusing his beautiful mind leads to such a frightening life. I am impressed with the depiction of the story which goes all the way from 1947 through 1994 when Nash received the Nobel Memorial Prize for Economics. The versatile Russell Crowe came across well in the character depiction of the overtaxed scientist who refused to take his medicine for his degenerative disease. Ed Harris convinced people that they should hate him for the harm he brought to Nash, even if he was a phantasm. Christopher Plummer was very good as the caring doctor, Dr. Rosen. Jennifer Connelley (my favorite) played her part well as the very concerned and very loving wife. Vivien Cardone, whose age was only in the single-digit column when the movie was produced, was outstanding as the little girl Marcee Herman who was taken with him; the character Marcee herself was a phantasm. Paul Bettany was excellent as the practically-vicious Charles, Nash's roommate; Charles himself was a phantasm. The only thing that family members should have been concerned about were the graphic and scary scenes, such as Nash's shock treatment and his cutting himself on the wrist. But overall, it was an excellent production. It was another great feat for producer Ron Howard, and, of course, for Universal, Dreamworks, and Imagine Productions. Intriguing in its own right, I'm glad I saw it. \n",

It shows the progress and changes made in both scientific and the social understandings, while also reveling the emotional impact this can have on those close to us.

As a person, I do not particularly care for Russell Crowe. The whole hoopla behind the Academy might have done him in for an award, but nevertheless, Crowe shines as John Forbes Nash, Jr. in \"Mind\". His performance was that of how the old times in cinema used to be--very in touch with their characters, and flawless in their performances. Russell Crowe is comparable to Tony Curtis's portrayal of Albert De Salvo in Richard Fleischer's \"The Boston Strangler\". Although they are complete different performances, Crowe delivers his with the same impact of Tony Curtis's character. Mr. Crowe was phenomenal, and to my wishes, was not overlooked by the Academy but simply given a close race against Denzel Washington. Many people disagreed with Nash's schizophrenia not being unveiled until the middle of the film, and I will admit that it was upsetting to me, but the good aspects of this film really overshadowed the slight flaws of dislike within the movie. I was more disappointed that Nash was not in fact doing all these things for the government and aiding us at the times of the Cold War. However, Nash's true genius made up for this factor and allowed the viewer to see that he truly was a genius but just one that simply had to overcome an obstacle that was so slight compared to the intelligence he possessed. \n",

But I hope audiences realize that almost everything in this movie regarding the relationship between Mozart and Saliery is simply made up. I enjoyed the realistic depiction of the life in Vienna during that time. Also, the movie partially grants an idea of what Mozart's personality really could have been like. But the whole plot is just a fantasy of Salieri (at least the movie version of Salieri, who is plagued by feelings of guilt, jealousy and self-awareness). Should one take it metaphorically? Mozart's struggle between life and art killed him despite being one of the greatest talents. While Salieri had to outlive him despite not coming close to this genius and being fully aware of it. It's like god's punishment for movie-Salieri.\n",

It is about Salieri, who is the court composer for the Austrian emperor and witnesses Mozart's rise from child prodigy to child-like adult. Salieri wants nothing more than to compose beautiful music, but instead his own mediocrity is made all the more apparent when contrasted to the seemingly divine talent of the impish Wolfgang, which irritates him to no end.

I especially liked all the court members like the Emperor, Chamberlain Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Kappelmeister Bonno as they struggle with Mozart, a music force clearly after their time.

It's incredible writing, acting, direction, costumes, set design, music, atmosphere, and portrayal make it a marvelous masterpiece. As much as people complain about the historical inaccuracy in this film, there's a lot of stuff they get right. For example, Mozart did have a troubled financial situation and connection with his father. He also did have a masked man ask him to write a requiem, and did work himself towards exhaustion, dying from it. He did behave like a child as an adult, having too strict of a childhood.

This film doesn't really have one good character to get behind, everyone has hopes and loses that you all feel, everyone is flawed and down to earth, I found myself never being able to ultimately pick one side in the film. Both characters are developed perfectly You understand just how much their music means to both of them and why they need to hold on to it, it gives a fantastic insight into there mind sets and makes them more investing as well as interesting characters. Every thing in this film production wise is fantastic all the eccentric costumes, palaces and gutters look perfect. F Murray Abraham won an Academy Award for his performance in this film and I've seen few performances more deserving he is so convincing as a conflicted man shamed with his inability to advance beyond mediocrity, he's perfect at balancing both the young idealistic and older fragile versions of his character, he always had me engaged and he was truly amazing in this movie. Tom Hulce who I have seen literally nothing else from is fantastic in this movie, he's over the top laugh, excitable tendencies yet committed nature made him an entertaining character to watch and was the perfect opposition for Abraham. It's also a very dark film to watch at times, the way in which these two men's lives begin to fall apart isn't truly heartbreaking as ,like is said, they are developed perfectly so you understand the stakes of their rivalry. But I loved that they didn't necessarily hate each other but were really jealous of each other and their eventual bond towards the end of the film made for an extremely satisfying conclusion to their arc. One of my only real issues with this movie is the love story between Mozart and his wife, it gets extremely repetitive and dull after a while and his wife was completely unlikable to I ultimately just ended up not caring at anything of her turmoil. Another issue was the present day story line with the mental asylum it was mainly he Actor who played the priest who gave a fairly bad performance, just relying on the same facial expressions to carry his portrayal and got on my nerves after a while.\n",

The first piece that I ever played on the piano was the andante middle movement of Mozart's first piano sonata, a piece that doesn't feature in the film but the movie drove me out of my status as a musical dilettante and into the ranks of musicians granted, a crappy musician but a musician nonetheless.

For many people I am quite certain that the movie was their introduction to the greatest composer who has ever handed down music. It isn't the music alone that makes this joining of music and film so successful but the way in which we are presented with the music, the way Milos Forman deconstructs Mozart's genius for the benefit of those of us without the benefit of a lifetime of musical training. This is especially highlighted in the scene in which Salieri views the young composer's work as he reads it on the music stand (K 361 Gran Partita).\n",

Salieri, a contemporary of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), lived his life insanely jealous of his exceptionally gifted counterpart. Salieri confesses to the Priest sent to converse with him after his suicide attempt, that he devised several plans in order to stunt Mozart's success. Salieri was fiercely jealous of Mozart's ability, and how seemingly natural that ability came to him, as Salieri devoted his life to composition mastery yet couldn't hold a candle to Mozart's compositions. Salieri promised his chastity to God in hopes of being imparted the gift of music by the hand of Christ. Salieri enjoys a comfortable living and career as court composer to Austrian Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The envy of Salieri eventually engulfs his entire being; he is dumbfounded as to why God could choose such an immature, petulant child to instill his most precious musical talents in. His envy has led Salieri to wage a war against the Christ he devoted his life to, and an urgency to bring about the downfall of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.\n",

            "Amadeus is a beautifully striking film, thanks in no small part to its reliance on natural lighting. Amadeus was filmed solely using natural lighting and it benefits immensely from this choice. Amadeus taught me that lighting in a film can have the most dramatic impact, even acting as a character on its own. I am moved by the lighting every time I watch the film, and it is my favorite part of revisiting it. Amadeus achieves a curious feat, it is a biopic in which one cares little about biographic inaccuracies. There are no historical records to indicate that the relationship between Salieri and Mozart was contentious as it appears to be on screen, yet, the story is so engaging that the audience is not tallying the mistakes the film makes. It's more than an engaging story, however, that keeps the audience from becoming upset at the miscues the film fires; Amadeus strikes the delicate balance of giving each principle character their due in the film. Mozart and Salieri are deeply flawed, yet gifted individuals and Foreman brilliantly expresses both sides of each man.\n",

            "Salieri makes a deal with God at a young age promising to devote his life fully to Christ in exchange for divine inspiration of his musical compositions. Salieri begins his devotion by solely studying music and vows to remain chaste, exercising extreme monastic-like discipline in his daily life. Salieri is pleased with the gifts he feels have been handed to him by Christ until he becomes aware of the superior expertise of Mozart. Salieri becomes obsessed with the idea of Mozart and anticipates the day in which he can meet the one God has given such musical talent to. When he finally meets Mozart, Salieri is shocked and disgusted by how juvenile the prodigy is. The interesting aspect of Salieri's repugnance is that he is so revolted by Mozart's childlike behavior, yet his fixation on the composer comes across like a son and outshone by his father's (God's) favorite child. Salieri knows he does not possess the talent Mozart does, yet believes himself to be more deserving of the superior talents. He begins to unwind right before the audience's eyes, decomposing from the realization that he has lived a life promised to another, yet, intensely unfulfilled. It is this great multi-layered portrayal of a jilted man that earned F. Murray Abraham an Academy Award for his role as Salieri; the role also won a Tony for Ian McKellen's brilliant portrayal of Salieri on Broadway. F. Murray Abraham played the part wonderfully and deserves each of the many accolades he received for his turn in the role. The standout for me, however, is the multi-faceted Tom Hulce. Hulce plays the childlike, workaholic, unsophisticated, professional composer. The rapid-fire shifts between facets of the boy genius are extremely well-acted by Hulce. A performance that necessitated so many opposite mindsets is no easy feat, yet one Hulce mastered with ease. As brilliant as Abraham and Hulce were in their roles, it would have been interesting to see Ian McKellen and Tim Curry reprising their stage roles in this film. (I wonder why neither were selected to star in the film having given acclaimed performances on Broadway)\n",

The film is three hours long, is narrated, involves heavily on flashbacks, and shows several compositions-operas mostly, of the featured composer's works. Yet, given the issues that may arise from these aspects of the film, Amadeus does not suffer for them.

            "Salieri referred to Mozart's natural music ability as if he had been picked to take musical dictation from God, this seemed to be supported when Salieri saw original copies of Mozart's work that showed no marks of corrections or signs of error. As Salieri is working with Mozart, he is taking dictation from the ailing Mozart, and having trouble keeping up with him or even understanding what he is to write; Mozart can hear the melodies he is creating in his head, a skill in which Salieri does not possess. It is never clearer than in his final moments with Mozart that Salieri, while being a gifted composer, has nowhere near the natural aptitude of his counterpart, Mozart. Given that the film is told from Salieri's forsaken viewpoint, Amadeus is a narrative that explores the raw emotion of a man who devoted his life to an art form that abandoned him and is the most painfully beautiful illustration of such I have ever seen. \n",

Amazing character that he was trapped in body of child and his dedication has driven him to the all sort of obsessions like the one over alcohol, after death of father it was obvious his character started to fell apart. Using everything against him and finally after his death Salieri was left without everything and you are able to see it in his behavior.

The acting is good, particularly from Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham and Elizabeth Berridge. The opera scenes were very well filmed, and to add an air of authenticity, the entire production was done in Prague and the opera scenes were shot at the actual opera house where Mozart's operas were performed. The only bit that was out of place, in my opinion, was the parody of Mozart's operas that Schikander did. It was just vile, along with a scene earlier in the film where Mozart engages in something that should take place in the bedroom betwixt a married (ie. straight) couple. The latter is fortunately brief, while the former is unnecessarily lengthy. But the theatrical cut is better, in my opinion, as I shall explain at length in the following paragraph.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, the screenplay fabricates a lot of things about Mozart's life (whilst getting some of them correct). I think that the theatrical cut is better because it does not include a nude scene, which is one of the major historical errors. Salieri leaving in the theatrical cut was more consistent with his characterization in the film rather than making him out to be a lecher (which came out of nowhere in the Director's Cut). In addition, Mozart never fornicated with Salieri's pupil; it was quite the opposite in real life. Another major blunder is Mozart saying that he did not like either Bach or Handel when in fact, Mozart studied with Johann Christian Bach, and also re-arranged and conducted several of Handel's works including the oratorio Messiah.\n",

It's hard to put into words but I guess the best way would be say that it's like you forget every piece of music you've ever heard before. And to be honest to talk about the inaccuracies of the story, there really isn't a lot that can't be ignored for the sake of enjoying this beautiful, creepy and incredibly intense masterpiece of film making.

It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly.

These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.\n",

A single note, hanging there, unwavering. Until a clarinet took it over, sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I had never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God. Director Milos Forman's Best Picture winning drama was indeed a masterpiece. Based on Peter Shaffer's extravagant 1980 Broadway play with the same name. The film tells a fictionalized biography of tortured genius and Viennese child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Also, the story was presented in a way that was very unique at the time. It was through the eyes of fellow jealous composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who finds the deeply crude and childish behavior of Mozart, unworthy of such praise. Driven by his attempt to outshine Mozart, Salieri must find a way to gain the audience of the Austrian Aristocrats, before it's too late. Without spoiling the movie, too much, a lot of people had complain that this movie wasn't historical accuracy. In my opinion, a lot of this criticize wasn't needed. To the film credit, Amadeus never claims to be a true story. It's normal for films like this, to sometimes diverge from historical facts in order to explore more fundamental and universal human issues and to achieve a dramatic effect. Yet, the film had more fact than fiction than most people are willing to taken. It did a lot of homework to get, as accuracy as possible. So, when I hear, some of the main complains that the critics point out about the film. I had to question, their short-temper justice. I felt like they were misinform. Many of the so-call historical inaccuracies were somewhat true. It's true that Antonio Salieri later claims he killed Mozart. Even Mozart toward the end of his life, swears that he's believe that he been poison, but in terms of Salieri doing it; its indeed historical fiction; due to the fact that most historians dismissed his mad ravings with that of a person whom clearly had his sanity deteriorated & the fact that Mozart fell ill while in Prague on Sept 6. 1791 where Salieri was clearly not there. Another claim, these critics spoke of, is how the film, portray a masked man wanting to commissioned a requiem from him in order to steal his work. In truth, it was very likely at the time for people to anonymously commissioned requiems from famous composers and pass them as them, off; but there was no reason why Salieri needed to. After all, his music was a lot more popular at the time, than Mozart. It wasn't, because Mozart was lazy. It was, because he was a fading child star, who had drug problems which both historians and film critics fail to notice that kept him working. I thought that Tom Hulce's immature performance as Mozart was very accuracy as it was very well documented that the composer had those characteristic traits even if it's a little exaggerated. However, the ever-present, idiotic giggle does get a little too annoying at times. About the fact that Salieri and Mozart were fighting for certain imperial jobs, it was true, but the reason why Mozart was never given a position on the emperor's courts, wasn't, because Salieri's envy of Mozart, but the fact, that Mozart's music doesn't sound typical 'Galant' & he wasn't noble. There was no reason why Salieri really needed to steal his work, as he was rich enough, and Mozart's work was a little too controversial at the time for basing works on Austrian's past banned materials and not being tradition. About Mozart's constant embarrassment of Salieri, such as seducing Salieri's lover, Catarina Cavalieri (Christine Ebersole). There is no evidence that Mozart slept with her. In reality, it is very likely that Salieri slept with Catarina, as it was generally known, at the time, that she was his mistress, and if they were still together years after 'The Abduction from the Seraglio'. If anything, Mozart and Salieri were, if not best of friends, at least on peaceable terms with one another, when it comes to sexual and musical conquest. He wasn't a saint at all. He even educated Mozart's younger son Franz Xaver Mozart, after the composer death. While, yes it's true that Mozart's work outlive, Salieri. It wasn't because Mozart work was better than Salieri. It was, because German nationalism began to take shape in Vienna with the birth of Romantic nationalism during the Napoleonic Wars. Italians were often view, as scapegoat of the war since Napoleon was one; thus Italian culture like it's music was somewhat banned from most European cultures during the mid19th century. This short ban, cause hits like Salieri to be nearly forgotten. It wasn't until, the late 20th century that most of Salieri's work was reintroduce into western culture with this film. The film was well-received by both critics and audiences alike with its lavish set and period costume design, music, visuals, and its acting. If the film had any faults, it would be the fact that the movie has pacing problems. It's way too damn long. 2h 40min is too much. It could had been cut down. Ultimately, the 1984 awards were monopolized by Amadeus with eight wins: Best Picture, Best Actor (F. Murray Abraham), Best Director, Best Screenplay Adaptation, Best Art/Set Direction, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Makeup. It became the 7th film in Oscar history to win eight Oscars. Overall: It's visually interesting, has dramatic intrigue acting from F. Murray Abraham, hilarious comedy, and introduced people to a part of history that was phenomenally fascinating and surprising, mostly true. I highly recommended this film. \n",

            "202 ) This movie is one heck of a experience that really knows how to hit the key notes. Sure, it has a simple narrative that is easy to follow but it's more driven by the vision and the experience for the audiences over the narrative. Now this movie has gotten some backlash, mainly because of it's depiction of the historical figures. So yeah, although the story might not entirely be focused on telling the exact truth, it does a fine job of blending fiction with reality. Because it does have important scenes that are deemed to be historically accurate or assumed to be. Never the less, the main focal point of this movie isn't to tell the step by step of Mozart's life. But to make it a experience that would draw the audiences in with it's depth and soul. Even the directing style comes of slightly strange when it comes down to it. So the story is told from the perspective of Antonio Salieri who was one of the well known composer during his prime as a composer. But in this film he is depicted as a mediocre composer trying to be more than what he is. Salieri in this comes across as a overly self-righteous, pompous jerk that has a huge jealousy towards the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since Mozart in this film is portrayed as a party guy that loves the ladies and just like enjoying the moment with his lavish spendings. Which kind of makes him a rock star during his time period. And since the demeanor of Antonio Salieri is vastly different from Mozart, Salieri not only makes Mozart his rival but his sworn enemy. Sometimes people like to pick apart and only try to focus on the negative side of someone they are jealous towards and that really shows through Salieri in this. He is a character that will do whatever it takes to bring Mozart down by slowly diminishing Mozart's chances to show his musical talents to the world to see. In this, while Mozart is a musical prodigy Salieri is a mediocre composer that is gifted in scheming, manipulating and has a very cunning persona. It shows the colliding of personalities and the ill intentions of Salieri as he picks apart Mozart. I also found Mozart's focus when it comes to his music and how he enjoyed life and his family to be touching and yet interesting. May it be entirely true or not, the man was a musical genius and his music will continue to carry on for generations. Overall though, this is a intriguing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed despite it being 3 hours. It's quite a depressing film though, so I probably wouldn't pick it up immediately to watch it again. But I will say, it is a splendid film and a experience.\n",

            "\n",
            "The voice of Salieri immediately spoke to me. This film in a way, is about the gradation of talent; one man who is gifted above all others ( or so he thinks) and is humble and grateful to god for his gifts, is suddenly brought to the realization that there are a few people, so far above him in talent, that he cannot even understand their method or genius. With humility he thinks \"this genius Mozart must too, be a humble, hard working man who has striven greatly for this level of talent to manifest. Of course Salieri is soon disabused of this fact. Mozart like most true geniuses creates so easily and naturally that he in a way is almost contemptuous of the toil which others must endure, to produce works which pale in comparison with his least trifle.\n",

            "The film is told in flashback by Salieri at the end of his life, confined in a madhouse, confiding to a young priest. He thinks that his actions lead Mozart to his death and is both proud and tormented by this. He is aware that Mozart is a \"true\" genius. Salieri has been flattered all his life with this word and he too, realizes that his great gift is the ability to discern the real thing when it is before him. He both loves and hates Mozart, as he both loves and hates himself , for being good but not great, but good enough to know good from great and being on the wrong side of the divide.\n",

            "204 )  This fictionalised take on the life of one of the most talented composers of all time is what I would describe as a once in geneneration film. F.Murray Abraham portrays the religious and sceptical Italian composer Antonio Salieri , who does nothing to hide his jealousy for the former child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). Salieri's bitterness towards Mozart yet his unwavering admiration for his talent cause Salieri to question his own faith, believing God to be mocking him for his own mediocrity. It's this developing rivalry that keeps viewers entertained throughout the film as Mozart grapples with alcoholism, his father's death, writing the Magic Flute and his crippling financial situation. We are constantly led to believe that it is Salieri who is such a negative influence on Mozart, eventually leading yo the composers unexplained death at the age of 35. He was writing the Requiem at the time of his death and it is shown that Salieri finishes it for him. The film then ends leaving us to ponder over whether it was Salieri who killed Mozart or if it was God who reclaimed his \"Beloved\", in reference to the Italian meaning of the film's title. This film is truly one of the great 20th Century dramas. \n",

He is Antonio Salieri and in the asylum he is visited by a priest, to whom he confesses that he killed Mozart. He then recounts his time as court composer to Emperor Joseph II of Austria. Mozart appears at the court and is hired by the Emperor to produce an opera. His genius is quite evident. Salieri is a devout Christian man and believes all musical talent and inspiration is given by God. Mozart's personal life and extracurricular activities appall Salieri. He cannot reconcile Mozart's talent and his lifestyle and sets out to drive him from the court. Initially his aim is to undermine him but over time his intentions turn deadlier.\n",

            "Most of all, this is an exploration of creative genius, the genius that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Forman, aided by Tom Hulce as Mozart, F Murray Abraham as Salieri and a wonderful orchestra and soundtrack, powerfully illustrates just how staggeringly talented Mozart was. For example, we have him writing down compositions without correction - he didn't need to play them, it was all in his head and perfectly formed. We also have Mozart dictating music he had just created in his head, showing his thought processes. His creative process is laid bare for all to see, and it is amazing.\n",

Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how \"The Creature\" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.\n",

Utterly captivated throughout the entire film, watching F. Murray's Abraham's portrayal of Antonio Salieri was quite simply, beautiful as it was cruel. You felt his pain, his anguish, he despised and revered Mozart as he despised and revered God for his predicament. Watching Salieri battle his own personal demons, his sincere longing to be known as a great composer, his frustration at his mediocrity and honest recognition of it, yet whilst he loathed Mozart, he loved him, rather was in complete awe of him and was the only one who truly understood the sheer magnificence of his work.\n",

A brilliant yet improper genius who hears and feels the music created inside of himself. Amadeus is excellently portrayed by Tom Hulce, as a bawdy conceited genius, with fabulous acting. The movie features dramatic renditions of Mozarts most popular compositions. The great court composer Salieri recognizes the raw talent and despised Mozarts frivolity. Salieri used his influence to try and suppress Mozart and make the spotlight his own. The sets are beautiful and detailed with great period costumes. Amazing score and cinema photography.

            "So declared Antonio Salieri, \"Patron Saint of All Mediocrities,\" friend of Mozart and mutual enemy of God in the impassioned and penetrating Amadeus. Milos Forman's Amadeus film version of a Peter Shaffer play of the same name based on a novel take on a rumor originating from the life of Mozart shook the world and nabbed eight Oscars the following year, including Best Picture. After being reproduced in many forms, could it even portray Mozart as truthful and powerful as the man really was? Frankly, no. No retelling of this genius' life can ever surpass the depth and power of Mozart's original story and life, but Amadeus gets awfully close to it. After reading the stage play and the film's screenplay, I felt that this movie was simply the luckiest achievement in film ever. The music, one of the best aspects of Amadeus (supplied entirely from Mozart's own compositions and performed by the prolific St. Martin in the Fields with conductor Sir Neville Marriner), creates a perfect dramatic effect while sampling a conception of Mozart's genius. Now, after viewing Forman's film, I visualize Mozart's music the drama, the context, and the inspiration behind the music. Listening to Mozart's music now, each note and phrase triggers a memory of certain shots and emotions from the amazing insight Forman and Shaffer gave in Amadeus.\n",
            "\n",
            "Retelling his story to a priest, Salieri recounted his conceited boyish prayer with God: \"Lord, make me a great composer. Let me celebrate Your glory through music and be celebrated myself. Make me famous through the world, dear God. Make me immortal. After I die, let people speak my name forever with love for what I wrote. In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life, Amen.\" Years later, Salieri, now an Austrian court composer in the service of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones), saw with sense of betrayal God's creation of Mozart. He knew Mozart's music was great, and his own was not. This fact alone did not worry him; it was the fact that Mozart was a coarse and vulgar boy. Often, he had talked and prayed to a cross hanging on his wall, but once his contempt overflowed, he gave it one last prayer and gazed at it once last time ablaze in his fireplace:\n",

I swear it! I will hinder and harm Your creature on earth as far as I am able. I will ruin Your Incarnation.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Ironically, although Salieri named himself virtuous and worthy of being God's \"Incarnation,\" the vulgar Mozart held a closer relationship to God -- even having a certain fear and respect of Him, of which Salieri had none. But taking on the action he had sworn to do, he held Mozart in his deadly grasp, gradually sucking away his money, sanity, life, and finally, his music.\n",

            "With a perfect balance of words, Shaffer crafted the infamous Salieri, whom F. Murray Abraham played with intensity, and surprised us with his remarkable transition between a bitter, yet free, elderly Salieri and a quiet and calculating, thickly accented younger Salieri. No one -- not even I -- would have thought the two Salieris were played by the same actor. Abraham speaks Shaffer's words with such resonance and a sense of illustriousness that they stand out in our minds, seeming as though his words alone had an impact on history.\n",

            "Never before or after Amadeus had a movie effectively portray an iconic classical music figure without ruining the drama and comedy. Most of us view Mozart as an indomitable demigod-like music figure -- even if we know as a fact that Mozart was crude, barmy and ill-mannered -- but we could never comprehend that Mozart was an actual living vulgarity. Indifferently, Forman and Shaffer tore to shreds the demi-god character of Mozart and gave room for him to shine his crudity. Many have complained about the historical inaccuracies of Amadeus, especially the ending scene where Salieri takes a dictation from Mozart for his Requiem. However, as Shaffer explained in the introduction of his stage play, he changed the ending for dramatic effects. Amadeus is not a biopic; it is a historical-fiction exploring the realms of humanity, hatred and God.\n",
            "\n",
            "Forman and Shaffer left many varied and clear-cut messages in Amadeus. Some say Salieri's downfall was caused by either his jealousy or the haughty demand in his childhood prayer, explaining why God attempted to destroy Salieri both great points and interpretations. But I believe that the explanation of God's wrath on Salieri is more objective. In his childhood prayer, he prayed for talent, and \"In return, I will give You my chastity, my industry, my deepest humility, every hour of my life \" But as none of those qualities were evident in the film, he earned that punishment. But wasn't Salieri's request for a righteous man to have the musical talent an honorable request? Perhaps. And perhaps God did fulfill that request, just through a different, yet pious and talented, Austrian: Franz Joseph Haydn. \n",

            "First, to the flaws: yes the insane giggle, trust me in the afterlife Mozart is going to be looking for both Hulce and the screenplay writer. It is both annoying and grossly disrespectful, please, yes, there are some people who say he was a bit of a libertine but don't have him laughing like a child molester! Second, the movie is an hour too long, the new extended addition compounds the difficulty; it really begins to drag near the ending. For those of you avoiding the movie, don't, the operas are shown only in brief snippets, you won't have to sit through extended periods of fat people screeching. I am with you, I adore classical music, most of it, but detest opera. The main reason to watch is Mozart's beautiful music which fills the entire movie. Even in scenes you may not care for, you get to hear some of his most beautiful music. The movie was criticized for its focusing upon Salieri's mortal hatred of Mozart but even more upon the unhistorically supported claim that he murdered him. As a movie reviewer, I am just focusing on the entertainment value of the movie. Abraham gives his signature performance that made him a star. Ironically, though it be Amadeus, Abrahams's Salieri dominates the narrative. The movie delineates him as spiritualizing his mediocrity as some kind of slight by God.\n",
            "\n",
            "When he witnesses Mozart's brilliance, paired with his moral debauchery, it sends him over the ledge. Mozart doesn't help things by mocking him in public, as my header alludes to. In a costume ball, someone yells out that challenge to Mozart, who mockingly plays the piano like a cross-eyed retard, culminating in his lifting his cape and loudly breaking wind at the conclusion of a stilted, dumb ass piece of Salieri's music. This is the heart of the movie, the growing enmity of the court favored Salieri, who gets increasingly involved in destroying Mozart. He cuts off his pupils, slanders him to the Emperor, and then, the most doubtful, plans his murder by working him to death dressed in the costume of his dead father: Leopold. This is not an idealized delineation, Hulce plays Mozart as a giant, narcissistic, arrogant child full of contempt for others. His childhood is briefly shown before we meet him testing the archbishop's patience by being late to his own public recital. The next scene, where he opens the doors to his cheering fans, while showing the archbishop his backside, is the quintessence of his personality. The movie follows his gradual decline caused by his extravagance and naivete about court politics.\n",

Until somebody makes a better one, I recommend it to you. Filled with his music, plenty of humor, usually at Salieri's expense, it was worthy of its Oscar. Abraham dominates the movie with his smoldering envy and burgeoning hatred for,\"My heart was filling up with such hatred for that little man.\" My favorite scene is at the end, confined to the nut house for claiming he killed Mozart, he pardons all those around him. \"I am the patron saint of mediocrity, I absolve you my child, I absolve you.\" The movie is told in flashbacks from a room where the local priest has come to test him about his claim of killing Amadeus.\n",

Powerless to stop it, me laughing at Him.\" For all its myriad flaws, my friends, it at least did not attempt to distill a musical legend to his pants and who they were blazing for like Immortal Beloved.

It's indescribable. F. Murray Abraham brings an astonishing performance, and so does Tom Hulce. The majority of the scenes are on the comic side, but those dramatic ones aren't missing. Wolfie (Tom Hulce), like his wife Costanze (Elizabeth Berridge) called him, is that childish mastermind, who modesty doesn't apply to throughout all the movie, yet it gives you joy watching him perform. Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) on the other hand is portrayed in two personas: young and old. They're quite different from each other. The young one is his position as a court composer for the emperor (Jeffrey Jones), and his old one is that of the narrator of the story. The emperor, now that I mentioned it, is a pulled-back, not-so-obvious character and his performance is hilarious, in my view. What's really about this movie that shouldn't be missed are the operas. Having heard them live is one thing, but this cinematic experience is unforgettable, hence: an omnixperience! \n",

He always wanted to appear educated and smart, but he couldn't even make a single statement without his crew\". Tom Hulce's Mozart was clearly a new approach. It helped to build up the story, and served as a perfect symbol of divine injustice. However, everyone's performance was dwarfed by F. Murray Abraham. I've never seen anyone who is capable of expressing amazement and hatred at the same time. He was balancing on this imaginable thin line through his facial expressions so well. Not a single word was necessary to see inside his head and understand his feelings. A very complex and well-built character with a sad and unfair destiny.\n",

You can work your ass off, but at a certain level, work can't beat talent. Salieri was clearly the Patron Saint of Mediocrity\". During a lifetime everyone feels at least once what it feels like to be mediocre (at something where you want to be the best), and Salieri's personal tragedy is a base that people can identify with. However, talent can't stand on it's own. We witness that total lack of respect always leads to self destruction. Mozart's passion for music was visible, but humility can't be replaced by talent. Talent vs. Commitment. Mozart had, what was missing from Salieri, and Salieri had what was missing from Mozart.

I laughed, and I cried, and it moved me deeply. I've seen it a few times now, and every time I watch it, I think after I have finished and am done and all the way through, I think to myself in my head, I think, \"Hmmm, that was a good one, I liked it\". I say to myself this, and then I say to myself, \"I'm hungry, I'm going to go make a pizza\". But dear friends, do you know what I do next, every single time? I make that pizza and watch the whole three hour cinematic marvel over again. At the end, sadly, I am hungry again, and desperately want, oh so desperately need, another freakin' pizza! Oh yes, it is a vicious cycle, one that I do not know from whence or where to escape. I fear that I am trapped in this sequence of events until who knows when. Who knows? Who can save me from this seemingly hollow and purposeless existence? Who? And an even better question? Hmmm? \n",

            "216 ) Amadeus, or Loved by God. We view this figure through the historical lens of an ageing and seemingly senile Antonio Salieri, but I am struck by how clearly his memory haunts him, however accurate his representation of Mozart may be. In reality, Mozart was not some genius whose notes came to him as easy as breathing did, but that is how Salieri remembers it. We see how beautifully his recount flows in the editing; how these L cuts create such magnificent sound-bridges which link each period of Salieri's fall and Mozart's rise like a symphony. A crumpled letter from the angry Leopold transitions into the sound scattering a flock of deer as the Emperor proposes his niece as a pupil. Caterina Cavalieri is one minute a student of Salieri, the next inexplicably the star of Mozart's Seraglio, another cruel blow. And in the most evocative scene of them all, where a disbelieving Salieri inspects Mozart's original works, and each turn of the page unveils another masterpiece, and both Salieri's are trapped in ecstasy. F. Murray Abraham's dual roles are masterful; in one he is silent, so caught up in the majesty of these ink-strokes on the page as he trembles, and in the elderly voice-over, recalling the discovery crystal clear, and we know how wrapped up he still is after all these years in conflict, in admiration, in respect, in bitterness and unbearable envy at being passed over by God. See the contempt as the father hums along to the recognisable strings of Mozart's Serenade No. 13. I must admit I too can only recognise one of the three, and so there is a little bit of truth in this dramatisation.\n",

            "Who does God choose? Not some respectable, esteemed genius but a rather crude and vulgar child playing games through the halls. The most iconic part of Hulce's performance is of course the peals of his high- pitched feverish laughter which seem to punctuate the guise of each formal setting that he enters. Some would say it is out of place. I would say that it is highly appropriate for Salieri's tales; the laughter becomes infuriating, and each instance of it only further confirms his anguish and disbelief that such a crass and unrefined brat be gifted with such musical genius. This is God mocking him with the same giggle, divine injustice personified.\n",

            "In its production design the film is of course gorgeous. The sets and costumes are detailed alike, bathed in natural light, and made alive. We see how exquisite dress is required for symbolising status, these great billowing gowns, ridiculous wigs and enormous headpieces, but it is the act of removing them that we get a more authentic characterisation, as seen in the nervously determined way in which Constanze offers up her body to boost her husband's career (and look at how defiant Salieri is, in refusing and determining he is to beat Mozart fair and square, not by some act of God). In another Director's Cut exclusive, as he plays a jaunty tune to cure a rowdy dog, these simple notes transition into the gorgeous 3rd movement of his 15th Piano Concerto. Other pieces of his work are brilliantly entangled into the drama. The immense, brash opening of Don Giovanni's Overture blasts as we break open the doors to find an elderly Salieri with bloody wrists and an inconsolable heart, wracked by the guilt of his sinful deed in destroying a genius. The same is used as Leopold re-enters atop a staircase in black, and as the same dark foreboding costume by Salieri is used to trigger his composition of his unfinished Requiem, and to loudly announce the death of a father. These moments hit us as abruptly thunderous as they do to Mozart, and his music mourns and weeps for him.\n",

His voice- over is so remarkably tender and the sounds of the symphonies reaches into his storytelling years and years gone by, as he describes what is simply notes on a page with the most unabashed admiration. And there is conflict, the most painful conflict I have ever witnessed on screen. Watch as his eyes shut in bliss upon Mozart's work, and as they scrunch up in petty glee upon a simple yawn. Oh, but he went to each and every one of those five performances. As he tricks Mozart into composing a masterpiece under his own name, he himself becomes entranced by the master at work. He formerly remarked that Mozart's music was as effortless as taking dictation from God, and here he can barely dictate the words coming from a bed-ridden Mozart. But still he is horrified as Constanze demands they cease composing, and lives the rest of his life in utter regret. In one conversation, he advises Mozart to end his operas with a bang, to inform the audience when to applaud. And yet, he knows in his heart that Mozart's music speaks for itself, and that the audience should know, as he so very much knows, when to put their hands together. And as I finished this film, I too knew this feeling. \n",

With the extended addition there is a scene with sexual nudity and the word c**t is used. That version is rated R, so watch out if kids are watching that version. If the schools watch it they should stick to the theatrical edition. Even though the theatrical edition is rated PG, it really is more deserving of PG-13. It has sensuality and a lot of drinking.

Screenplay examines his juvenile behavior interlocked with musical plays while detailing his relationships. He is haunted by the inability to please his father. His wife lazes in bed by day yet offers sensible advice. Then there is the court composer who narrates the film in a confession to a Priest in an institution. Director Milos Forman creates one of his best films complete with glorious art direction. Tom Hulce is flawless as Mozart who knows how good he is despite his outbursts in creative expression. F. Murray Abraham plays off the envy of Salieri who hates Mozart yet loves the music to the point where he forces the unfinished final work even when Mozart is on his death bed. Elizabeth Berridge plays Mozart's wife who begins as a free spirit young female until marriage where she can sense Salieri's true nature. Roy Dotrice plays off the haunting presence of Leopold Mozart, Wolfgang's strict father. Jeffrey Jones plays Emperor Joseph the second who is also in attendance.

The former is depicted as a boorish brat and playboy who can nonetheless compose some of the finest music ever heard by human ears, the later as his opposite: a dedicated musician who is nonetheless consigned to be 'the patron saint of mediocrity.'

Murray Abraham's Salieri in his admiration for Mozart and his genius, although my admiration was geared towards Milos Forman's outstanding direction and not on the actual composer himself. What a unique experience this three hour film was for me. Amadeus was a movie I had been putting off mainly because of its extremely long running time and its subject matter: a biopic about a classical music composer, but what a pleasure it was to finally get to experience it for the first time. My concerns about this film couldn't have been so far off because this was such a rich treasure to discover. Amadeus is a timeless film, directed in 1984, it could just as well have been directed today and you wouldn't notice the difference. Everything from the art direction and the set pieces, to the costumes and makeup, to the cinematography could rival any film released this year. I still can't believe this was made in 1984 because it is better than most biopics made today. Just as the central figure of this movie was such a creative and talented composer, Forman proved once again to be way ahead of his peers and was a prodigy director during the 80's. I thought there was no way he could top his marvelous work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but he just did. To say this is one of the biopics ever made is an understatement, because it is one of the best films period. Roger Ebert couldn't have said it better in his review when he wrote, \"the film is constructed in wonderfully well-written and acted scenes -- scenes so carefully constructed, unfolding with such delight, that they play as perfect compositions of words.\" Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, the Oscars oddly awarded the more deserving film that year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Amadeus couldn't have a more suitable and meaningful title, taken from Mozart's middle name which in Latin means \"loved by God,\" the film explores the tormented relationship he had with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), the court composer of Austrian Emperor, Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was so passionate about music that he begged God to make him the best composer the world had known by promising to remain chaste and devoted to Him. We learn this during a confession he is giving to Father Vogler (Richard Frank) after having attempted to commit suicide and confessing to being responsible of Mozart's death decades ago. The film is told in flashback as Salieri narrates what an impression Mozart had made in Vienna during his youth. He was eager to meet this prodigy who God had blessed with such an immense and unique talent, but when Mozart (Tom Hulce) is finally invited to perform at the Emperor's court, Salieri is shocked by what he discovers. Mozart is a childish and vulgar fellow with an obscene giggle that only seemed to mock everything he believed about God's immaculate and pure music. Feeling betrayed and confused as to how God could allow this hideous being to be blessed with such an amazing talent, he makes it his personal vendetta to defy God and bury Mozart's career.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film centers on themes of artistic genius and creativity as well as professional jealousy and uncomprehended talent. The universal theme of man against God is also tackled throughout the three hour runtime. These themes are perfectly explored and balanced with comedic moments scattered throughout, which allow the pacing of the film to move at a pleasant beat. Very seldom do you find such a perfectly balanced biopic that manages to remain comic and tragic at the same time. Some of the success of Amadeus must be attributed to the gorgeous location in which the movie was filmed. Choosing Prague to depict the mid 1700's Vienna was a perfect choice and the stages where the Opera scenes where performed were simply mesmerizing. Forman also allowed his actors to retain their American accents which was another intelligent choice. There is no need to give the actors silly English European accents if you are going to have them speak in any other language other than the original. The screenplay adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Award winning stage play was also a hit because the dialogue in this film is truly inspiring and I can recall several great quotes from it.\n",

The inner conflict he experiences as he easily goes from admiration and bewilderment to hatred and jealousy while listening to each composition is outstanding. Tom Hulce is just as great playing the titular character. Never in a million years would I have cast him in a role like this, but it only added to the underlying theme of looks and talents not always going well together. Hulce's cheerful and giggly demeanor slowly grows on the audience as he is first presented as an irritating figure, but gradually begins to appear more sympathetic, and our initial alliances with Salieri begin to turn while he grows darker. I could go on writing about this amazing film, but I feel no matter what I have to say about it, it's simply going to be another mediocre review of an incredibly masterful film.

Even after death, he can't get over how inferior he is to the master. What a great antihero. A jerk to end all jerks. Adding to the ridicule that makes Amadeus so unique, is Mozart himself.

Salieri then recounts his life, how he met Mozart, etc. He tells the priest that, through a fortunate turn of events (including his father's death), he was able to travel to Vienna, 'city of musicians'. He was successful there, wanting to create music in service to God. All was well until he met Mozart. Salieri was confronted with a composer who far exceeded his abilities. Salieri believed God was talking through Mozart's music and Salieri realized his own music paled in comparison. This was a shock to Salieri which was only amplified by the fact that Mozart was a 'sensual' man, a lover of sex and wine, etc. Why, Salieri asked himself, had God made this 'monkey' his instrument instead of me? The rest of the film shows Salieri and Mozart conversing and trying to get through their careers and lives, with Salieri desperately trying to conceal not only his passion for Mozart's music, but also his hatred for the man.\n",

            "I could spend several paragraphs swooning over the film's technical achievements (which are vast) and the quality of the acting (which is great), but I'd rather discuss something else, something I believe is the key to this film's success. What I find the most intriguing thing about Amadeus is the fact that it was still massively successful (winning 8 Oscars) despite not being historically accurate at all. Granted, not all historical films need to follow the history books to the letter to be successful, but the amount of changes that were made in Amadeus were pretty substantial. You can look up various articles detailing the differences. I'll name one: Mozart's laugh which, as you may recall, was kind of funny or annoying your mileage may vary. As seen in the trivia section on IMDb, 'there are claims that the laugh was taken from \"references in letters written about him\"'. A quote by Robert L. Marshall follows stating there is no historical evidence that Mozart had such a laugh. Its use in the film is purely dramatic, because Salieri sees it as the gods mocking him.\n",
            "\n",
            "So yeah, the film deviates quite a lot from reality, but I think these deviations and the way Amadeus turned out are precisely the reason why the film was so impactful at the time, as it was for me when I saw it in my early teens. The reason it was so successful (and still is) despite all the historical errors is because in the end it isn't really a biographical film, but a film about the people behind the music. It doesn't merely throw classical music at you and telling you to like it, but it shows Salieri obsessed with the transcendent nature of music and his frustration when he realizes he doesn't have what Mozart has. The film conveys the notion of music being capable of expressing the inexpressible. This is why scenes like Salieri salivating over Mozart's 'originals' have endured the test of time, because it's not just about the music. It's about the people behind it. This is where I think a documentary would have failed. Sure, it would have painted a more historically accurate portrait of Salieri and Mozart, but film is more easily capable of delivering an emotional impact. Instead of merely showing the lives of Salieri and Mozart, the central focus is their (particularly Salier's) obsession with (Mozart's) music. By telling the story through Salieri, we see Mozart through his eyes and we too are baffled and amazed by Mozart's genius. This is what Amadeus does right more than anything: introduce audiences to classical music in a way that captures the imagination. That's what it did for me. Like I said, this was my entry to classical music. In a spur of the moment, I told my parents I was going to compose a requiem like Mozart did. Naturally, I never did. I know little music theory and never seriously composed anything. It was a spur-of-the-moment thing, but the important thing was that Amadeus made me that excited about classical music. I too wanted to experience the level of excitement and transcendence that Salieri experienced through Mozart's music.\n",

            "This all reminds me of Leonard Bernstein. He's of course considered to be one of the great conductors, but what I think proves that claim more than anything was his ability to convey his passion to the audience. Just watching him conduct is an experience in and of itself. Again it's not necessarily the music itself that excites, but the people who bring it to life and it's this major achievement of Amadeus that makes it a classic and a must-watch. Well there it is. \n",

His only weapon was his ugliness. This also didn't stop all people from using him like a performing monkey. He was homeless and ugly, still satisfied with how he looked like and created excuses for his mother who left him as a baby monster. He was also proud that she was beautiful unlike him showing her picture to anyone he liked. He was poor and lived most of his life in the slums, also a man of fine taste and talent.\n",

            "Then, there's \" Amadeus \" it's mozart's middle name and it means god's beloved and we can say it's a reason for salieri to envy mozart whenever he says his name. Where we can see salieri drowning in his own sea of envy and hatred wondering why god chose mozart to have this great gift and to be his instrument. Wondering if god denied him the talent why he gave him the longing. He justified that he just wanted to praise god with music of his own even if it was just one piece of true music. But what if god just don't want to be praised by you. If god denies you a talent, it's never a reason for you to envy and hate all the talented people. God gave him a lot. Why did he insist on this one thing? Look at what salieri had. He became the emperor's court composer. He had fine wealth and servants. He was loved by most people as he said until mozart came and took their love.\n",

And of course the elephant man kind of people doesn't always has to mean only ugliness, there are more than ugliness that isolate them from the society. We all know these people whom we call freaks, nerds or schmucks. Well, most of them are freaks but sometimes if we knew them quite good, the truth would be a lot different. And for you, so you never can turn to be a salieri person, you must remind yourself every time you wake up in the morning with what gifts god gave you. Instead of forgetting all these gifts praying for one that will never come. \n",

I also like how the movie integrate the music into the whole picture, especially on the music writing scene later on. The perspective in the story-telling is also a very nice aspect of this movie. By using Salieri's view of Mozart, the movie nicely confirms the adagio of a hater is indeed a true lover. Especially in this case, the hater is someone who also has quite a talent though not equaling Mozart himself. F. Murray Abraham nicely portray the old Salieri very well, projecting the amazement, hate, guilt and envy all at once. Tom Hulce quite successfully depict his role with the stupid maniacal laughter. \n",

Not just the physical appearance, a bunch of talent, or even the incapability. Human is indeed the conscience itself, the feeling of empathy, or we can say the very soul of human. It is connected with characterization of the movie. The more \"human\" the character is, it indicates the rate of the movie. But, that's technical. In addition, the biography-movie must have very strong character and improvisation. And, \"Amadeus\" drives away the human value in a delightful way.\n",

            "Of course, nobody will not expect what a vulgar man Mozart would be. We just live in a different era with him. The movie just capture the reflection of Mozart by his letter, so we can enjoy Mozart that has peculiar personality. I give applause for Tom Hulce, he gave his best for this monumental role. A strong protagonist combined with the stronger antagonist, just make the complication feels so perfect. How wonderful F. Murray Abraham act for this cinema. He deserved the Oscar, without a doubt. The feature simply about two sides of the paradigm, we can understand how Mozart and his rival, Salieri, defines how they walk their life. You know, it's just make me realized, that even the talented man like Mozart, still had so many classic problems, like family, economics, or relationship. Meanwhile, Forman crafted the act well with the other elements of movies. Such as, the music. Of course it's about a musician, you must make the great play-list in the movie-sequence. So do the make- up-artist and the setting-maker, great work for them. At least, you can really feel the atmosphere of Vienna in that century by watching it. At last, the scenario is just a breakthrough of the biopic- movie. In my opinion, the historical correct is the best way to define each person. Yes, I know some of the part is incorrect, but the personality of each role is nearly perfect. A history-adviser accompanied Forman to make this movie. Of course, Forman can't follow all the historical-advice, he is more concerns with the entertaining way to provide that history. And he did it awesomely. It's very complex, but the world admitted the achievement of Forman.\n",

Story-telling-movie from the man who is jealous with Mozart. Yes, the hater of Mozart, in front of clergyman. A smart way to define someone. More than that, I just can see the talent of a Mozart, very real-visualized. But, humanity is met the struggle of the world, you know like foods, money, and fame. Even the genius man can reach all of that when he ignore the basic lesson of how to live in his era. People just admire, and it's not the guarantee that you will be helped by them. Unfortunately, Mozart didn't master it. He is genius in one way, but idiot in another way. \"Amadeus\" brought all that value in a very emotional way. It's 3 hours though, but you won't regret it. There are always reasons why someone make this movie this long.\n",

The actor performances are wonderful, all of the music is extremely well done, the entire movie is... well... awesome. It is for that reason I give this movie 9/10 stars. Sure, they took a lot of liberties with the story, but those liberties worked extremely well in making to movie really interesting and really good.

The second pair of scenes really adds nothing to the movie. The first two cast Salieri in even a more negative light. None of them is in any way necessary, and the two scenes in the country do slow the movie down. At 160 minutes, the movie never dragged for me.

Even that didn't appease him, so what does one artist do to another to ensure that they don't succeed? Drive them to death, of course! In a plot twist straight out of the classic Gothic horror, Salieri disguises himself in an evil looking masked cape which Mozart's own deceased father had worn, and hires Mozart to write a requiem.

The madness takes over when Mozart has an affair with the star of his Turkish opera whom Salieri loved. On the opening night, Mozart's engagement to another young lady (Elizabeth Berridge) is announced, which upsets diva Christine Ebersole and alerts Salieri to their affair.

These shows are fully staged musical dramas which happen to be totally sung through, making the old fashioned style of opera seem totally pretentious. His operas like \"The Marriage of Figaro\", \"Don Giovanni\" and \"The Magic Flute\" are all lavish fantasies or tragedies, and are brilliantly recreated here with the Academy of St Martin in The Fields.

In fact, King Joseph (Jeffrey Jones) happened to be Marie Antoniette's brother, and mentions briefly the issues going on with the French people. Poor Mozart isn't some obnoxious show-off fool; He's given many different dimensions that make him truly likable and interesting. Salieri isn't a one dimensional villain, either.

Through that relationship, with the priest claiming to offer God's forgiveness, Salieri confesses his awe, jealousy and manipulation of the young genius, ultimately playing a key role in driving him to an early, overworked death.\n",

            "It's majestic, moving and utterly beautiful. It's a study of guilt - who doesn't reach Salieri's age without secrets they need absolution from? It's a study in the corrosive powers of success - the film's Mozart is perhaps most akin to a modern day elite sportsman, feted with praise and money he doesn't have the maturity to handle. It's a study in marriage under pressure - Constanze, Mozart's wife, is brilliantly played by Elizabeth Berridge; devoted to her husband, but one partner always just out of reach of the other.\n",
            "\n",
            "Most of all, it's a study in creativity and what we who benefit from the creativity want the creators to be like. Mozart should be as sublimely beautiful, dignified and upright as his creations. Instead, as this film and Tom Hulce's performance renders him, he's an obnoxious brat with an annoying laugh, no discipline and no self-control. It's that laugh that divides viewers; it's that laugh that Salieri hears even before he first lays eyes on the man he discovers to be Mozart. How can this man create such beauty? Thereby hangs the crux of the film, and Salirei's existential torment. It drives deals he strikes with himself and with God; it defies belief and offends the ears as much the music entrances them. It reaches its height in a spellbinding, unforgettable scene where Salieiri helps a bed-ridden Mozart work on his Requiem (a piece commissioned by a shadowy figure Mozart doesn't realise to be Salieri himself). Mozart hears the music in his head and dictates it to Salieri, who even then can barely keep up. Even with his nemesis at death's door, he can't hope to match him.\n",

The film is so true that the accents are frankly irrelevant; I'm not distracted by them, which I most certainly would have been by bad European accent imitations.\n",

He never touched women, he helped the musicians in the community, and he taught children, a lot of them for free as a way to thank God for answering his prayers. He was completely faithful, never harmed anyone until Mozart came along into the scene of music in his own community. The \"giggling dirty minded\" Antonio says, gains much more fame and becomes well known throughout Europe which drove Antonio frustrated because even when he is sticking to God, Mozart still got more fame and more successful, and in Antonio's opinion it is not fair because Mozart is as far away as possible from God.\n",

For all other people this movie can be a true wake up call to see that classical music is not boring, but just the opposite!

Murray Abraham) in an asylum after attempting suicide, asking for forgiveness for murdering Mozart (Tom Hulce) in 1791. His story; his confession; this film, is told to a priest by the name of Father Vogler (Richard Frank). \"Amadeus\" takes place primarily in Vienna, from 1781 until 1791, when Mozart dies. Through Salieri's words, we are able to see Mozart as he is (supposedly) when away from public eye, and the picture is less than ideal. Mozart, although still an undeniable genius and musical prodigy, is also immature, rude, selfish, and has no respect for his wife, children, family, nor anyone else in society.\n",

To make this worse was the fact that this was all in the director/writer's imagination. Yes, this is historical fiction. And I understand that not all facts portrayed in the film need to be historically accurate. However, although this has been perfectly fine for me in other films, in this film, it simply did not work. I really wanted to like this film, I did. But I could not. I had to force myself to watch most of the scenes, saved purely by beautiful costumes and melodious compositions.

It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run.

Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me.

He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri.

But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of \"The marriage of Figaro\" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from \"The Magic Flute\" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.\n",

When Salieri, shortly afterward, gets a look at Mozart's flawless musical works, he becomes increasingly aware of his own insufficiencies. His initial praying to God that He may grant him the ability to match Mozart's compositions changes towards the end into surrender and the willingness to commit plagiarism.

And with no meaningful internal or relationship turning points to keep us interested, the movie plods forward trying to make us pity poor Mozart. The movie limps to its inevitable conclusion and drags us through a 3 hour picture show with no drama. Even the subplots of Mozart's fame (which endures) and Salieri's fame (which dies) are not punctuated with highs at the end.

            "259 )  Amadeus Amadeus is a biography of Mozart as told by Antonio Salieri. It shows the rise and fall of Mozart brought about by external factors and his own. It showcases the life of not just Mozart but also of Salieri. The movie starts in the present with out of control bleeding Salieri and his confession of having murdered Mozart. It is a flashback of his time and his journey with Mozart. Salieri is jealous yet almost reverent of Mozart. It depicts his love for music but lack of his geniuses. Mozart on the other hand is irreverent and lewd but a genius from whom music flows as if God himself speaks through him. The movie shows the trials and tribulations of Salieri to out do Mozart, at the same time the dedication and frivolity of Mozart. His obsession to rise above him yet to seek his approval leads him to actions with far greater impact. The movie though titled on Mozart, is of Salieri and how Mozart played a very crucial part in his life. Amadeus in Latin means \"Loved by God\" and is an apt title for the movie. Mozart as the man of god is a common theme of this film. Many a times Salieri makes this comparison and begrudges it. F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart are brilliant. They provide life to larger than life characters. The hatred, the reverence, the desire to share that one moment of fame are emoted effortlessly by Abraham. The tinkle laughter and boyishness of Mozart as played by Hulce, remains with you. Every emotion feels realistic and though set in time long before the present, where the styles of expression were a lot different, the movie manages to convey itself flawlessly. The supporting cast is brilliant with its effort. The costumes are grand and the sets are lavish. The depiction is interspersed by the music of the operas. The direction is fast paced and doesn't loose the audiences at any step. The film is vibrant yet dark. It carries with it deep sadness of the human emotions, But also celebrates life through the language of music. \n",

First of all this film shouldn't be named Amadeus after Mozart it should be named after Antonio as the film is all about him! We are introduced to Mozart about 20 minutes, they cast a rubbish American actor, they should have trained him to do a German / Austrian accent, that would have made the film immediately better! Also Mozart acts like an immature retard, maybe he was like that but where is the evidence!?

Most of the story shows last years of Mozarts life, his character, his career, his personal life and his death. The technical part is done well, especially the scenery that makes a visual impression fantastic. Mozart's music is blended into the content of the film and is a great foundation for consistently strong atmosphere. It's a shame that some potentially great scenes were somewhat ruined with very bad camera work although Forman generally did very good job. Besides the historical inaccuracies that pervade the entire film, bad reactions were provoked by the choice of Tom Hulce as Mozart. Tom did great job, he gave his best and probably did all that was asked of him but he's just not suited for the role. Shaffer and Forman vision of Mozart is maybe correct, but it certainly is different from vision of biggest par of the audience. F. Murray Abraham is brilliant in the lead role of Antonio Salieri and was rewarded for it with Oscar and a Golden Globe. The movie won 8 Oscars and it's shares that number with movies like Gandhi and Gone With the Wind. The screenplay is very good in almost every aspect besides historical inaccuracies. The characters are wonderfully developed, the dialogues are strong and most importantly the story keeps viewers to the screen for the entire 160 minutes.

Mozart (Tom Hulce) is about to compose a piece at a palace in Vienna (Home of the musicians). Whilst eager to meet Mozart, expecting him to be a talented, humble and grateful young man, discovers that he is actually a lewd, immature deviant. After witnessing Mozart perform, then seeing him memorise an entire piece of Salieri's music almost instantly then play it to him, he grows jealous of Mozart as he realises that god has chosen a simple, undeserving boy rather than a devout, dedicated religious musician (himself) to be bestowed with such talent. Salieri then devises a plan to get Mozart to write an absolutely perfect piece of music, his requiem mass, then dispose of Mozart and take the credit for it. He would finally gain his victory over Mozart as he will dispose of him and god as he must now watch Salieri get the recognition he finally deserves. Only time will tell if it will work...\n",

Coming from me, thats a rarity (check out my other reviews, I'm not kidding I always find something negative apart from AC3).

The film is a must watch for everyone or I would say an important film. Because it is about Mozart, the name that we all have heard since childhood. The length of the film is long. I watched the director's cut which is about 3 hours and to watch a film 3 hours long I had to think a lot before watching. But I must say that it was 3 hours of pure fun. The acting from both the main characters is superb. The story keeps you attached to the film always(mainly because of the acting.). Then at some point of times you will find opera shown at length and the interesting fact is that you will like it. I must say it was 3 hours well spent.\n",

            "264 )  The story of what music meant to an aging \"Patron Saint of Mediocrity\" told to a young priest by our afflicted Soliere after being committed to a sanitarium. This ranks as my top musically oriented masterpiece. The symphonies and operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart hauntingly decorate the jealous and humorous results of those surrounding the King and his minions in their attempts to corral the young, but gifted, composer. Tom Hulce (as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart) is absolutely passionate about his perfect music and F. Murray Abrahams' Soliere is a genuine gift in expressing many a musicians frustration of never reaching Gods' ears with ones works. The idea of mediocrity being a sin is expressed by our anti-hero so well at the end that I always reflect on my own limited musical expressions. Well, there it tis! \n",

            "265 )  I would have preferred to have seen more of his thought processes though, because Forman's glimpse of how Mozart applied his genius is extremely exciting to watch, but short lived. Characterisations are brilliantly engineered. Salieri is scheming and yet outwardly indifferent to Mozart. We can see that he loves the music of his superior, and yet is torn apart by his own inadequacy. Inadequacy is a fitting word for Salieri's skill as portrayed by Forman, who wanted to give the greatest contrast possible in terms of the virtuosity of the two men, without making Salieri look like a complete cretin. He is, after all, known as maestro Salieri. Constanze Mozart (Elizabeth Berridge) is on first appearances a giggling girl, and yet through the course of the film we are shown that she is very shrewd, and is ruthless when dealing with finance. Roy Dotrice's Leopold Mozart has a masterful air, and maintains an oppressive paternal hold over his son even after his death, the analogy being the use of an enveloping cloak. The cloak is used as part of Leopold's street wear, but is also part of the costume of the statue in the first showing of Don Giovanni, where Salieri is certain that the imposing figure of the giant statue represents the recently deceased Leopold. In short, Forman presents us with a marvelous psychological essay on weakness and power, both superficial and real. This is obviously no average biographical motion picture, but a film conceived with an intelligence nearing that of it's subject. We are shown Mozart's virtuosity several times, which again provides wonderful excitement. He not only plays variations of his music thought up on the spot (at the party scene) but plays them in the styles of other composers, upside down. He infuriates Salieri by arranging a welcoming march actually written for Mozart (and taken to be wonderful by the Italian up to this point), showing off his outstanding skills whilst looking around at the assembled courtiers and cackling with glee. Those who have watched this scene with me have either laughed or smiled in sheer wonderment at a majestic combination of music, acting and direction. This film is a gem, combining sometimes ridiculous comedy with deep tragedy. On the negative side, it would benefit opera buffs more than concert goers, because opera is the dominant musical genre of the movie. (Specially designed opera productions have been woven into the film; greatly extending it's length but adding that extra colour and vibrancy). The film becomes heavy and slow moving as it nears its astonishingly refreshing conclusion at the lunatic asylum, noticeable largely due to the contrast with a lighter beginning. This may test the patience of some viewers, but once the credits roll, I guarantee that the majority of those who have watched Amadeus will be struck by the passing of such a wonderfully colourful and rewarding masterpiece, and will not want to move from their seats until the tranquil piano concerto fades away. The film deserves all its eight Oscars, and I give it 9 out of 10. \n",

            "266 ) Sometimes, it's hard to be a retired history teacher. After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as \"Pocahontas\") with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While \"Amadeus\" is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in \"Amadeus\", facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.\n",

            "Now if you completely ignore history, the film is good---very good. The sets and costumes are lovely and it looks as if you have been transformed back to the 18th century. It certainly deserved Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Direction, Sound and other technical categories. F. Murray Abraham is great as the conniving Salieri--even though he's very fictional. Tom Hulce, on the other hand, is so annoying at times with his horrid and piercing laugh that I could see why this film didn't result in him being catapulted into stardom. Without this laugh, he would have been MUCH better.\n",
            "\n",
            "Why couldn't they have just created a story about FICTIONAL characters instead of fictionalizing real peoples' lives?

And that laugh...that HORRIBLE laugh has got to go! \n",

            "267 ) I re-watched AMADEUS recently for the first time in over twenty years and, I must say, it is pretty terrible. The characters have about as much depth as those found in Coen brothers' films; the whole Mozart-Salieri is nearly totally fictional; the sordid, soap-operish (no pun intended) relationships between virtually every character are pure Hollywood pap but most importantly (and offensively), there is NO historical basis on which to portray Mozart as an over-sexed, philandering drunkard who took nothing seriously other than his own fame. Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart's notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren't so prominent in the film I wouldn't take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn't even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called \"Mozart\", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce's Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.\n",

            "268 ) Give something that rhymes with Mozart and a kid today would say \"Old Fart!\" since Mozart is only reserved for those high-brow, supercilious opera-lovers who feign to appreciate actual music. Well, many people do pretend to be connoisseurs of art, but there are a few who can actually find a communion with music. One of them was Antonio Salieri, a decent composer but a brilliant connoisseur of music. To him, as he said it himself, Mozart was 'the voice of God', and Salieri could actually understand the genius' thought process behind writing the music. How would this man of extraordinary skills be of character? Would he silent the entire audience with his eloquence and profoundness, outside his music, as a person?\n",
            "\n",
            "In 'Amadeus', Salieri gets his answer; if the true Mozart were like this, which is highly unlikely, then he would think of these high-brows as 'dlo trafs!'. In fact, Mozart, in Amadeus, is a prodigy in music who never takes anything seriously. Salieri wonders how such a creature could possess such genius; he feels God has purposely avenged Salieri by bestowing upon him average talents while handing Mozart infinite capabilities. As a lunatic in his old age in an asylum, Salieri narrates his life to a priest. In the amusing scene, Salieri plays two of his compositions to the priest and asks them to guess the name of the song, but the priest isn't able to. Then he plays a very familiar tune and the priest immediately recognizes the tunes. Salieri sighs, and slowly tells him that it was 'not' his work, it was Mozart's. It does not come as a surprise here: when I type Mozart in Word document, I get no spell error, but the moment I type Salieri, it is underlined in red!\n",
            "\n",
            "Poor Salieri believes he has killed Mozart, and tells the priest about his lifelong dream to be a great composer and his contempt towards Mozart, the person while reverence towards Mozart's music. Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fiendish, vulgar, lascivious and crude genius who later shows his soft side while Salieri is a passionate, soft-spoken Italian who then becomes two-faced, contemptuous, and monomaniacal and later lunatic. Mozart and his wife struggle to earn money while get fame and respect, while Salieri gets money and fame but struggles to earn talent. For Salieri, it is an internal defeat and hence he tries to bring down Mozart in whichever way possible while wholeheartedly lauding his music.\n",
            "\n",
            "Much of the film is shown from the viewpoint of Salieri, but then shifts to Mozart's own personal life and hardships. The maid has been thoughtfully kept so that Salieri is able to tell from Mozart's point of view, in case some would be wondering how Salieri knew so much about Mozart's personal life. When Salieri tells about his first experience with Mozart, where the latter is shamelessly caressing his lover under the table in the palace, Mozart plays by telling his lover then wife, Constanze to guess the words spoken by him backwards, then speaks all lewd words. It does feel out-of-place hearing some of the lines here, especially 'eat my s**t' and 'kiss my a**' but nevertheless funny. The scenes with the Count in the palace are absolute bananas, especially to observe the stark contrast between Mozart and the others. Even Salieri's constant plotting is very interesting and enjoyable, especially his most knavish act with Constanze.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Amadeus', however, fails to provide a thorough justification to its initial build-up. We know how Salieri loved Mozart's music but hated Mozart himself but the moment Salieri's role diminishes and the focus shifts to Mozart, it is difficult to actually sympathize with Salieri's guilt. It is a very common phenomenon, like if we have one actor playing a character for a period of time and then another actor takes his/her place and the audience feels a bit alienated. Also, Tom Hulce gave his Mozart a one-dimensional comic book quality that showed him throughout the 160 minutes of the film as a person of mediocre talents except when playing in those operas in the theater. It is almost impossible to believe that this Mozart was so profound, and 'Figaro' and 'Requiem' were his compositions. I'm not saying that an artist has to have that aura always; I have foul-mouthed, alcoholic, erratic friends who are good actors/musicians/composers/businessmen but these people had a certain quality in them that I could associate with their talent. And this erratic Mozart should have had that quality in him throughout the movie which could make me believe that he was the Mozart indeed. And the incongruous accent doesn't help either.\n",
            "\n",
            "Salieri is played beautifully by F. Murray Abraham; his effectively gives his character the shiftiness while advising Mozart and honestly while praising his music. But I found the climactic scene between the two characters to be somewhat underwhelming; I know it was difficult to execute, but it still had to have so many more emotions stirring up in such circumstances. This also wore off the effect of the grand catharsis, which is similar but not as effective as the endings in Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'A Clockwork Orange'. Much of this I find fault with Tom Hulce's sterile performance.\n",

The music itself was brilliantly performed, all of them. One could see the faults with Salieri's congested arrangements and feel the depth of Mozart's compositions, especially in the requiem for his father. And I discovered that these compositions did have words- I was dumb enough to think these singers were warbling just notes, no words! \n",

            "Now seriously Milos Forman did an amazing job. It keeps impressing me when Salieri takes original sheets how we see the projection of what he sees and of what's written on the paper. How on paper it looks so ordinary, but what we see and what we hear doesn't match. First a gentile sound of flute, just a few notes, nothing else, and then violin interferes... But then, suddenly Salieri turns the page. Now it's a whole new piece,the music changed into to a much more vibrant tempo, it's a whole new story now, and with the music changes the atmosphere.\n",

            "Also, the story's beautiful. The way that Saliery envies Mozart and desires something that he has, how he turned his back on him, how he fought with God for giving Mozart the talent and giving him for reward only the ability to recognize it.\n",

            "The hardest part for me is when Mozart dies. In the background you can hear his Requiem, La Crimosa at that time.

It makes you ask yourself: Doesn't he deserve more? Now we don't even have a stone to call his grave, we know there was no difference of the final resting place of one of a kind music genius and any ordinary man who made no difference in this world. But we still have his music.\n",

            "When there's no fanfare, special effects, or 'kiss-n-chase' element drowning the actor in a boisterous facade, when the actor must endure in medium and close-up shots armed only with the integrity of the script and his own innate ability to convey it, that is the hardest acting of all, and Abraham is nothing less than absolutely perfect in his role, projecting the most delicately controlled nuances of expression and mannerism.\n",

Murray Abraham as Salieri is flawless, Tom Hulce gives a fleshed-out portrait of Mozart's brilliance and his (according to the film) frivolous personality, and Elizabeth Berridge and the other principal actors put in solid performances too. The music works well with the scenes; my only complaint is that some of the opera scenes get a bit long. However, all in all this is an excellent piece of work.

And he does an exquisite job with both of them. Tom Hulce is a great W.A. Mozart: flamboyant, funny, pantagruelesque, playful and solemn at the same time. All the actors did the best with their parts. I remember the scene where Mozart's maid cries before Salieri...just look at her facial expression. The horror is so real! Or when Salieri reads Mozart's manuscripts: that is the look of a transcended man; Salieri looks like he just had an orgasm. This movie has a lot of strong points, but the acting is the best of them. I have mentioned just a few, but Orsini-Rosenberg, capellmeister Bonno, Emanuel Schikaneder, Katerina Cavalieri were all played masterfully.\n",

When it comes to movies such as 'Titanic' or 'Avatar' i simply can't ignore the fact that those 2 films are kinda \"forgettable\" when you compare them with other much better James Cameron films such as 'The Terminator' or 'Terminator 2' or even better 'Aliens' but after seeing 'Avatar' once again i gotta say this film is actually pretty good. Avatar has some really good cgi although not 100% believable James Cameron created a nicely beautiful World with some good and interesting Characters inside it, the acting is also really good by mostly everyone especially Sam Worthington although i felt that Stephen Lang's character was getting annoying after a while. The aircrafts that they use threw out the movie do look like the HK's from T1 and T2 a bit if you think about it and those giant cool looking robots were kinda inspired by Matrix Revolutions (2003) and even that old Superman Cartoon from the 90's. Now where the film kinda struggles is when it comes to it's pacing because the whole 1st act and half of the 2nd act do get a bit slow and although it doesn't completely hurt the film it is still an issue but thankfully the movie picks up from the end of the 2nd half all the way threw the 3rd and personally best act of the movie where it basically turns into a giant war against Blue Aliens and Humans. Many people said that this film isn't quite original and that it mixed Dances with Wolves (1990) with Aliens (1986) and Smurfs and in a way it does in fact mix a lot of different films but that isn't such a big problem if you ask me. What bothers me is the fact that Cameron wants to bring back Sigourney Weaver's character who clearly died and even Lang's character that couldn't even possibly survive those 2 arrows in the chest and even if the film ends with Jake Sully opening his eyes and becoming a full 'Avatar' the movie still doesn't need so many sequels that James Cameron is planning and that is the problem with modern Jim Cameron he is focusing on stuff that don't make sense and especially 'Avatar' that doesn't need any actual sequel and i'm concerned that this might be Cameron's first big mistake but i hope that i'm wrong. As a romance and as a drama 'Avatar' is definitely 10 times better than 'Titanic' and the same goes for it's action but when you start comparing it with T1 and T2, Aliens, True Lies or even The Abyss the movie just looses it's magic against some of 80's and 90's best films.

            "281 ) \"Avatar\" is an American movie from 2009 and still the most recent blockbuster movie by writer and director James Cameron. He dominated the awards season over a decade earlier with \"Titanic\" already and things looked similar back in 2010 when only \"The Hurt Locker\" managed to keep \"Avatar\" from winning all the very big prizes. Ironically enough, the former was made by Cameron's ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow which made for some interesting references (and bad jokes) at the Oscars back then. But still \"Avatar\" won three trophies at the Oscars alone and many many more during other big awards ceremonies. There are several versions out there of this film when it comes to the runtime and the longest is probably the director's cut that comes incredibly close to the massive 3-hour mark. Your choice if you want to go for this one the original theatrical release for example. You can decide it perhaps if you plan on rewatching this extremely long and extremely blue movie before the sequels come out as it seems Cameron still wants to go through on his plan of releasing no less than four sequels to \"Avatar\" until 2025 that he has worked on in the last decade.\n",
            "\n",
            "The cast includes Sam Worthington who is the lead actor here and it is definitely the by far biggest work of his career. Add to that Cameron's longtime collaborator Sigourney Weaver and relatively young actors like Giovanni Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez or Zoe Saldana. The main antagonist is played by Stephen Lang who as usual elevates the material. Oh yeah, CCH Pounder is on board too and deserves the mention for sure. Basically, there are two kinds of people when it comes to \"Avatar\", those who really absolutely love the movie and think it is a revelation and then those who think it is all pretense and nothing special at all. So it sure is a clash of extremes and I personally would say they are both in the wrong. The right approach is somewhere in-between. \"Avatar\" is a movie that is breathtakingly beautiful on many occasions and that offers a solid story that is nothing too great though. But it also offers basically fight and war sequences for 45 minutes or so, basically the entire last third of the movie. And this is where the film somehow lost me to be honest. It is just too long for basically nothing but action scenes, even if lots of important stuff (deaths mostly) happens during that time.\n",
            "\n",
            "As for the film's frequently discussed environmental message, I am a bit undecided. I think the general concept of showing how humans (or Naavi) should live in peace with nature and all its creatures, plants and animals, is a honorable one, but it is also pretty simple because you could wonder the extent to which the taming, i.e. the violent submission, works against this principle for example. But you could write pages on this subject to be honest, alone about this movie, and at times I must say I think it takes itself more seriously than it should give the substance it has and messages it is sending. I read frequently that people compare this film to \"Pocahontas\", but it's been so long that I have seen the latter (Have I at all?), so I cannot really elaborate on the subject. I think \"Avatar\" offers enough to enjoy the movie as its own creative achievement and even if it has sequences where it drags a bit, it is still very much worth watching, preferably on the big screen. If you have a chance to do so (again), then don't miss out. To everybody who hasn't seen \"Avatar\" yet (if there are actually people out there that fit this description), maybe wait until the new films come out and then I am sure many cinemas will show this original film before and you can watch it there and then decide if you are interested in more. This is (as almost always with Cameron) by no means an actors' movie, even if some have baity material. It is really all about the messages and the world and the environment in this movie. All about the visual side basically. A whole new world. Maybe not a whole new movie as there are considerable weaknesses in here without a doubt. One of the better, but not very best films of 2009 I would say, one that deserves neither all the hate nor all the praise it's been getting. And for closure, let me say that the song during the closing credits is also pretty amazing to listen to. \n",

            "282 ) Avatar was released in 2009. It used the greatest special effects of its time to display a survival story. A disabled marine chose to take his dead brother's place on a mission to Pandora, a distant universe. Once there, he finds out about a plot to kill the native people to utilize their resources. The marine, Jack Sully, tries to gain the trust of the Na'vi natives in order to gain information about their people. He then tells this information to the commander to find the Na'vi's weaknesses. Jack soon falls in love with a native princess and learns the Na'vi's ways. He realizes what his mission will do to these people and their lives. Jack decides to help them fight against the humans who have come to their universe. James Cameron, the director, spend over 10 years perfecting the special effects of Avatar using CGI. There are several great examples of this through this film. The best example is when the princess is teaching Jack how to fly the mountain banshees. The CGI created a giant world of floating islands of mountains where the banshees lived. It took almost two years for the banshees alone to be made. I gave this movie such high ratings because of the special effects used throughout the film. The theme of this film is survival. Not only survival of the Na'vi people, but also the survival of nature through the advancement of humanity. The Na'vi people consider nature to be their lifeblood. It is the center of the universe and they have learned to live around nature without destroying it. The threat of the humans destroying their lifeblood is why the Na'vi fight so hard. The colors of this film were incredible. Bright blues, yellow and reds show great emphasis on the theme. These colors were inspired by nature. The forests were inspired by areas of China and Venezuela. Avatar showcases bio luminescence with the plants in the forest. Also, the costumes in Avatar were incredible. All the character's costumes were hand made. This seems like a waste of time on a mostly CGI movie, but every character, including the Na'vi, had costumes made for them. The Na'vi's costumes were individualized to each one, which showed the nature of their people. This film was a great accomplishment within the special effects film. The technology used to make Avatar had not existed before. The team needed to accomplish this was massive and many of them worked to discover new ways of shooting this kind of movie. \n",
            "\n",

            "284 ) Avatar was totally robbed at the Oscars that year by the silly movie 'hurt locker' about a bomb that might or might not go off.... such a boring shallow move. Avatar is a better movie, a huge achievement.\n",
            "\n",

            "Good solid original entertainment, Avatar demands a big high definition screen and full HD viewing. It does what other films only try to do, and that's take you on a journey away from everything for two hours, with action, suspense and technically fantastic visuals.\n",
            "\n",
            "The one criticism worth mentioning is that some of the dialogue is typical cheesy Hollywood, and feels too safe. It's as if they went for \"standard\" dialogue because they didn't want to detract from the surrounding visuals. That was a mistake. They should have refined the script and made it more intelligent, with added depth to some of the story elements. That can all be forgiven however, because of the enormous scope and creativity of this great movie. \n",
            "\n",
            "285 ) I may sound like I am exaggerating, but this movie has, from my perspective, such a surreal complexity, that the viewer (at least me) can feel a deep and warm connection with it. I think it was made in a way to *blow* the person watching it with lots and lots of stunning imagery and dynamic action, but not in a way to overwhelm him/her, but to make he/she feel relaxed and intrigued by the worlds and characters presented. It may seem like a movie about aliens, but, from my point of view, it reflects more the human nature and behavior. This movie is for me more than mind-blowing, it is a relief to see that we, as humans, can create extraordinary fictive worlds, and not just that, but the hope that one day we could live in those kinds of realms, we could create our own version of Utopia, through collective work and passion. And now I am just excited to see Avatar 2 in 2018 as I was when I began seeing the firs part of this movie. \n",
            "\n",
            "286 ) This science fiction adventure film set in the 2150s has very good special effects - but that's its only appeal. There's little else to enjoy in this rambling and insubstantial extraterrestrial fairy tale.\n",

            "287 ) Just like my rating. This movie are excellent and perfect. I don't like sci-fi and action movie at all (usually). But i felt different for this movie. When i saw this movie at the beginning, i felt like \"oh this movie will be great\". I do love romance movie but this is the first action/sci-fi movie i've ever watched with all my heart and i gave 10 on my ratings. Seriously.\n",
            "\n",
            "First. This is James Cameron movie. No doubt, it will be great. And he prove it. The cast oh my god, so perfect. I mean really perfect. Their acting are not too much, but made us felt if we were inside the movie and the situation. This movie use a lot of scientific language but magically, i understand that. And the conflict, wonderful. The plot sounds good. But when i watched it, it was really great. i've got a lot of emotion when i watched it. I've got a love story, family conflict, threatened world, and effort to save the world in this lovely movie. I mean, this is a whole package movie. I love it! \n",
            "\n",
            "288 ) I don't know exactly why but I really love this movie. I am that kind of people who wants to see a movie once most of the time but with this movie, something is different. If I saw it anywhere, I can't change the channel, I always watch it through to the end again and again. The amazing visuals, the story, the whole movie is really good, I think. \n",
            "\n",
            "289 ) This has to be my favorite movie of all time! I remember the first time I saw it on opening day and loved it. It's perfect: awesome action cool visuals (after all, this is the highest grossing movie ever), and Fantastic acting. This movie is, in my opinion, one of the most memorable. I highly recommend this if you are in to action movies. I really hope they make a sequel. \n",
            "\n",
            "290 ) Pros: -- Superb CGI, -- Amazing planet -- Mysterious World (with so many unanswered questions that are still left to be answered in other sequels) -- Original Alien Life (So much better than the retarded looking aliens in Star Wars)\n",
            "\n",
            "Cons: -- A very familiar plot (just happens to be on another planet) -- Weak Acting\n",
            "\n",
            "In a nutshell, going forward, Avatar needs a new plot line. The familiar story of whites driving Indians from their native land is too boring. The sequels need to dive much deeper into the Alien way of life and the whole mystical spiritual side of their existence. Maybe, instead of white men being the evil, their is some kind of evil within we can learn about? Because if we keep expanding the original plot , of white men trying to take blue monkeys' gold and kill them off for profit, I can already see this franchise going into abyss. \n",
            "\n",
            "291 ) Excellent!!!!!!!! The characters,the story...it has action,sf,love-story,it really touches you. I still love this movie...me and another few billions;-) At the beginning I was a little bit suspicious:blue people,animated movie..but it is nothing like that.The actors really worked hard in order to make this to look real........I also liked the story...I really could feel like I was a part of Pandora,I wanted to be a character,to join them saving that beautiful world.I loved Neytiri,they made a good job,very beautiful.Congratulations to the team and ,of course,to my favorite director,James Cameroon. I really hope that the next Avatars parts will bring me joy as this one did.Good job! \n",
            "\n",
            "292 ) Warning: military Types Won't Like This This is the best war film about the victims I have ever seen. Cameron makes one of his greatest films of all time. This film really did feel fantastic and everything seemed metaphoric but real. After reading the reviews' page, I would say that most of what happened in the film is a metaphor on history. Obviously, certain events that happened in reality were not as is, and some of the things that happened in the movie did not happen in reality. One of the things that I didn't like about the movie was how much was left to imagination, and there was only backstory for a few seconds in the beginning and middle. Overall, I really did enjoy this film, it presented the historical facts in the guise of fantasy really well. \n",
            "\n",
            "293 ) The movie as a whole was a memorable experience. Personally I saw it as a metaphor for what the western world calls \"third world\". The \"Pandoran\" people did not want a thing that developed countries had, and western people didn't understand that, so they thought of them as unintelligent beings that talk to their trees.\n",
            "\n",
            "The CGI was amazing and I usually despise the use of CGI. The world was awe-inspiring but the rest was just mediocre.\n",
            "\n",
            "The acting was horrible. The only actor that acted their role correctly was Zoe Saldana, she was great throughout the whole film. The writing was similar to an Adam Sandler movie and the music was as generic as a musical score can get.\n",
            "\n",
            "It still is a must-watch film, because of the gorgeous world they created. But not necessarily a must-watch-till-the-end. \n",
            "\n",
            "294 ) This movie is my favorite! It has amazing special effects and jaw-dropping 3D shots! The world of Pandora is amazing with beautiful scenery and includes landscapes that defy gravity. Amazing action sequences include robots that probably inspired Pacific Rim, not to mention large battles and warfare as well. Last but not least, their is tight romance that explodes at a tense point. Overall, this movie is James Cameron's best work in motion, and a critical darling as well. \n",
            "\n",
            "295 ) I saw this epic last night at the Empire Leicester Sq in London, which is a superb venue in which to view this film. Huge screen, excellent sound and an extraordinary Dolby, 3 dimensional image. The whole effect is mind blowing.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a 'Must see' movie, innovative, and extraordinary. I think it will be regarded by most cinema goers as another milestone in the history of the art. The level of realism achieved is remarkable, and although the film is relatively long in real time, it retains it's excitement and holds the audience's attention to the end.\n",
            "\n",
            "Performances are good, but this is not the sort of film that dwells on big star value for the actors, although Sigorney Weaver does shine and delivers a very convincing performance, as do the rest of the cast. But as there is so much entertainment and action value on screen the human element does not dominate in the usual way. \n",
            "\n",
            "296 ) When \"Avatar\" first hit the theaters back in early December of 2009, I really didn't have an overwhelming urge to see it, as I'm usually very skeptical of films that base their hype on CGI- based graphics (as they usually overshadow such important elements as plot and character development). However, with the film surpassing Titanic as 1 all-time in box office revenues, I figured I would give it a shot, thinking maybe I really was missing out on something special. Unfortunately, the film did much, much worse, as I left the theater wondering how such a shallow movie could now be on top of the heap.\n",
            "\n",
            "The number one flaw in the film is one that it truly cannot recover from in any other aspect: a terribly shallow plot. If you have seen Pocahontas (white man must learn the ways of the natives) or Dances With Wolves (disgruntled military officer sympathizes with former enemy), you have seen Avatar. There really is nothing else.\n",
            "\n",
            "Adding to that fatal flaw is the high-handed directing of James Cameron. While some great directors (Clint Eastwood immediately comes to mind here) will present an interesting palette of characters and let the viewers decide what they may about them, Cameron instead chooses to be rigid in his character definition. For example, the military is evil, scientists are greedy, and all natives are perfect in their commune with nature. If you have your head in the clouds, then perhaps those kinds of moralist viewpoints will appeal to you. For the rest of us, it is quite sickening. Basically, it turns into 162 minutes of Cameron slapping you across the face with his environmental/naturalist themes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Thus, as far as character development is concerned, it practically does not exist. Besides the utterly predictable transformation of the \"one good white man\" and his assimilation into the native culture, no other background is explored on any character. I am fully confident that any decent writer could sit down and, within a day, put together a much more interesting backstory on certain aspects of the film (military, scientists, etc.) that would actually make the conflicts of the film compelling, other than the bleeding-heart sap it turned out to be.\n",
            "\n",
            "Plus, and this is truly the coupe-de-grace of failure, the CGI produces some great images, but unless you are a complete tech-head, it isn't really anything to fawn over. For example, the sinking of the Titanic in Cameron's other big film was just as eye-popping as anything that Avatar put up on the screen.\n",
            "\n",
            "To be honest, it really makes me shake my head that a movie like this can not only succeed in this country, but do so in record capacity. Have we really become so thoughtless and simple to reduce humanity to such black-and-white constructs? I'm sure that the Academy Award voters will have a field day with such themes and turn the ceremony into Cameron's own private ego- massaging, but I for one do not see it that way. If you are looking for a great director who will really make you think about humanity, try the later films of Clint Eastwood. \n",
            "\n",
            "297 ) The first time I saw the trailer for this movie I was immediately interested. And this movie exceeded my expectations. With a story that is easy to understand but very intriguing. Plus stunning image results and the results were very mature CGI. Plus a very skilled actor playing a character each. At the end of the story I never thought that Jake Sully would be like \"that\". Avatar (2009) is the best movie I've ever seen overall. Neither of stories, pictures, and characters. Very amazing. \n",
            "\n",
            "298 ) I've avoided this movie until now, however when a neighbour invited us to visit and watch it while being amazed by his 3D video system, diplomacy meant that saying \"no\" was a little difficult.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was every bit as bad as I'd heard. The story was cliched, simplistic and quite cynically aimed at all those \"liberals\" who recognise the evils of colonialism and greed. The characters were, at best, cardboard cut-outs. So why did I give it two points? Well, I do have to admit that the colour and CGI scenery were impressive, as was the 3D effect - though by the end my eyes were beginning to complain.\n",
            "\n",
            "Had it come on the TV at home, I'd have promptly changed channels and I'm very glad I did not pay to see it as, apart from the special effects of various kinds, this is a load of arrant tripe. \n",
            "\n",
            "299 ) James Cameron is a force of nature. Except for George Lucas, and to some extent, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron is, in my mind, the only blockbuster director in the world who brings to his movies an all-encompassing, ambient spirit that is completely his own. A James Cameron movie is simply a bigger deal than everything else. Avatar ups the ante. Every Cameron trope is out in full force: Bad-ass chicks, space marines, over-the-top action, and a sweeping love story. Avatar is in many ways an amalgamation of everything that makes James Cameron a unique voice in Hollywood. Elements of Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss, True Lies, and Titanic are distilled here into a singular vision. Avatar is a truly remarkable accomplishment, the ultimate James Cameron movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "Avatar's ambitious story has Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) traveling to the rainforest planet of Pandora to replace his late brother in the Avatar program, which allows certain humans to inhabit a body that resembles that of Pandora's native humanoids, the Na'vi. The leader of the Avatar program is Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), who hopes to use avatars to peacefully interact with the natives. Meanwhile, others, including the CEO, Parker Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi) and the military leader, Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) are looking to exploit the Na'vi and expedite the mining of Pandora for a precious resource called unobtanium. Jake Sully is caught between these two worlds when he meets Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a blue-skinned Pocahontas who introduces him to her culture.\n",
            "\n",
            "Jake's inner conflict drives Avatar's story, and it works beautifully... for the most part. Yes, it is a lot like Dances with Wolves in construction. Learning from and becoming part of a new culture is nothing new, but Avatar presents this classic tale in a fresh way. Sully is a paraplegic. His avatar allows him to be free and fully able. It makes sense for him to view the Na'vi life as an opportunity to start anew. His relationship with Neytiri, however, is not as successful. The love story has potential. Sully's wide-eyed desire to learn and Neytiri's spirituality could gel, but those traits aren't fully explored. Compare this love story to Cameron's other movie romance, Titanic. There, we could see clearly what both characters thought of the other, and why they needed each other. The love story made sense because of who the characters were. In Avatar, the love story seems to exist as a plot device; to force Sully into changing allegiances.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another thing keeping the love story down is Neytiri. James Cameron has never been known for subtle characters, and Avatar doesn't change that. Dr. Augustine is a tough-talking scientist with a penchant for cigarettes, Colonel Quaritch is a hard-as-steel military grunt with a giant scar across his face, the CEO practices golf in his office, etc. The point is, these are caricatures. Neytiri is no different, but somehow she comes off as irritating where the others are appealing. Neytiri is a tree-hugging hippie, spewing jumbled \"bio-spiritual\" philosophies at every turn. That's fine, but her spirituality eventually devolves into a lecture on the evils of military conquest and deforestation. It's a little heavy handed. Additionally, I can't get past Zoe Saldana's performance. She plays Neytiri as shrill, pretentious, and bad-tempered rather than bad-ass. She is annoying. The problem is, If I don't find her personality attractive, how can I relate to Sully as he falls in love with her?\n",
            "\n",
            "The love story doesn't work and the Neytiri character is off-putting, but my problems with Avatar end there. This is a major filmmaking achievement. James Cameron creates, in Pandora, the most rich, realistic, and fully realized fictional world in the history of cinema. From a design standpoint alone, the imagination ingrained in the animals, plants, and vehicles is absolutely staggering. Pandora is miles ahead of everything else in terms of diversity of life, and what's really astounding is that with all these varied alien elements, Cameron somehow makes this place feel real. From the high-tech, lived-in military bases to the elaborate Na'vi culture, with its palpable sense of history, Cameron's attention to detail in Avatar is revolutionary.\n",
            "\n",
            "So too are his technical innovations. The extensive motion capture and CGI used to create Avatar are as convincing as any special effects I have ever seen. The Na'vi characters don't give off the slightest hint of CGI sheen. Avatar stands as the very best example of \"performance\" capture. The actors are there. The CG middle man seems nonexistent. The Na'vis, the creatures, the mountain-sized trees, and the bio-luminous plants are nothing short of photo-realistic. All the superlatives in the world can't completely do justice to Weta and the team that brought Cameron's gargantuan vision to reality. Avatar is the gold standard in special effects, period.\n",
            "\n",
            "Avatar's success might be attributed to how Cameron balances the film's many tones. Avatar works as both a science fiction adventure, with some of the most thrilling action scenes ever put to film (The final battle alone is more exciting than 99% of blockbusters before or since), and as a classic Hollywood epic. Every type of moviegoer can connect to Avatar in some way, whether it's in the action, the effects, or even the romance. Technically, Avatar represents the height of what big-budget blockbuster filmmaking can be. There is not another movie quite like Avatar. The film overpowers you with its sheer size. Avatar is a massive production; An event imagined and shot on a scale bigger and bolder than anything I've seen. Like Titanic, it exudes its own unique spirit. Helped by James Horner's beautiful score and Mauro Fiore's epic cinematography, Avatar totally envelopes us in an exotic world. As an original masterwork of popular entertainment, Avatar deserves its spot as the biggest hit in movie history. James Cameron's magnum opus is bad-ass and yet, beautiful -- a truly special experience.\n",

            "94/100 \n",
            "\n",
            "300 ) Cameron really knows his drama. A tear-jerking love story, the heartfelt downfall at its climax: he applies the rules of drama like few others can. That said this reeks of a routine to go for. Despite such skills deserving high praise its repetition can't be said to be the epitome of greatness. On the contrary: besides these qualities we'd like to have some substance. To make things shine is great but a lame standard shining bright is a lame standard still. Nice colours, lots of emotion and baffling CGI: it is almost to be held against a film if all it does is hiding the mediocrity of its plot and its implications (\"its meaning\" that is). That said Avatar may still be the film that uses 3D technology best. That spells genuine innovation and adds to cinema as a whole.

            "There is a lot more to it though. The setting as such betrays a deep insight into the Zeitgeist, into the hidden desires of present time viewers. It is an ode to technology, to the possibility to shape one's self as well as connecting to others. At the same time the demolition of the old and the bringers of this technology are put in a harsh light. Indeed: we do not trust our own progress. We love it and fear it at the same time. We wish for unlimited possibilities, the transcendence of time, space and body, yet we also wish for stability, harmony and peace. It is impossible to fulfill the conflicting desires of our time. Or is it?\n",

            "Avatar manages to combine the conservative and the progressive and that is not a small feat. Living as an \"Avatar\", like me being Mario in a Video Game, is where it starts. Right into the promises of the past: actually meaningful human relations, breaking things down to the eternally important parts of life, a harmonious tradition. The clash is quite literal: the colonial high-tech army against the natives of a paradise, living in harmony with themselves and their nature.\n",

They can \"upload\" their experiences, \"download\" the past and connect to other living beings by \"jacking in\". That is exactly how they \"become one with nature\", how their \"natural\", \"traditional\" lifestyle works. They manage to unite our conflicting desires and truly appeal to something most people do not even see. It is keen insight that looks immensely deep what is required to create this specific instantiation of a superficially glossy fantasy world. It's the \"Internet Indians\", the unity of everything, that many oh-so sophisticated viewers overlook when complaining about the flatness of this eye-candy.\n",

Where Matrix actually does hold depth, although not behind every Greek name and wisecrack reference, many others did not. Lots of references, likening one's film to insightful classics: people see depth where it is supposed. This one on the other hand appeals to emotions and thankfully never really pretends to be a piece of philosophy. Only that it is. It truly is a milestone.\n",

Titanic's Jim Cameron set out to revolutionize movies with immersive 3-D technology which promised to be unlike anything audiences had ever seen. Since its release, Avatar has drawn enormous crowds; word-of-mouth and repeat viewings have lead, within a mere twenty days, to its claiming the title of 2nd-highest grossing film of all time worldwide.\n",

Others have blasted it for perceived racism, with the \"white savior\" rescuing indigenous peoples. Some have said that the film is anti-military. Most claim, however, that it is simply great entertainment. In my opinion, the truth of all these claims is somewhere in the middle.\n",

            "Regular readers may notice that I almost never divulge any plot information in my reviews. I don't like to read reviews that give away large chunks of narrative; I've never felt it was the critic's job to tell me the story, and I'll pay you the same courtesy. I will say, first and foremost, that the film is neither the political lightning rod some have made it out to be, nor is it worthy of the hype and box-office its receiving (I can think of many movies that deserve a wider audience). It is, however, constantly entertaining and artistically stunning.\n",
            "\n",
            "Everything you've heard about the visuals is true. This is not CGI (computer-generated images) for just for the sake of it, nor is the 3D merely a gimmick. Cameron has succeeded in created a completely immersive new world. These are not special effects; this is art. The 3D serves to truly make viewers feel as if they were on a glorious foreign planet, with its own ecosystem and amazing wildlife.\n",

            "Though the heroes are interesting enough, the villains are mostly one-dimensional. Sam Worthington and Sigourney Weaver do fine work, as do several others, but the only truly exceptional acting is by Zoe Saldana (Star Trek) who plays the princess of an alien tribe. Her work, via motion capture, conveys rich, tender, and savage emotion. So skillfully does she portray both the humanity and the strangeness of an imaginary race that the audience connects with her more than any of the human characters. She, and the rest of the alien tribe, are utterly convincing.\n",

Its theology works in its imagined universe the same as The Force does in Star Wars.\n",

            "I take a more moderate stance than the film does on conservation, as it paints those who mine natural resources as greedy at best and evil at worst.

Unoriginal maybe, but hardly racist.\n",

How this movie made so much money is a marvel because this movie reminds me of what Battlefield Earth's potential could have been. The biggest problem with this movie is that I never felt a connection to the people of Pandora and I agreed with the Colonel. I think that Jake Sully was very ungrateful for the chance to go here and that he is a traitor for not carrying out the mission. You know a movie fails when you are hoping that the so called \"good guys\" are the ones that you want to die. Overall, I do not understand why this movie made so much money and was able to such a success. \n",

There are some original ideas in terms of the world the story is set in, and the actors don't do a bad job with what they're given to work with, but I could see everything that happened next coming from a mile away, and I became more and more turned off as the movie progressed. After all the hype surrounding the release of this one, especially given the success of Cameron's previous productions, I left the theater with a really bad taste in my mouth.\n",

It is by far the most impressive film ever made in the visual department. it took a lot of efforts and years of waiting to come up with such an advanced CGI effects and motion captures. to this day, 7 years after avatar was released, i haven't seen even one movie that can be compared with avatar's visually beauties. No, Avatar doesn't resemble Pocahontas in any way. It doesn't have any direct connection to other films. It is an original story, which is refreshing since most of the new movies are based upon or rebooting something else. James Cameron made the two most financially successful movies of all time - 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', and it's not a coincidence. This guy is a real genius! I recommend Avatar to ANYONE who appreciate the art of films and the fact that a movie is not perfect without it's beauties and visual factors. 10 out of 10. an unworldly masterclass! \n",

            "306 ) Avatar is a story about an ex paraplegic marine, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), who has to replace his late brother in a mission on the distant planet of Pandora. His mission is to infiltrate the native colony of the Na'vi through the use of an avatar. His mission is to earn the trust of the Na'vi and convince them to resettle so that the greedy corporation can obtain possession of a precious ore under their settlement. When he disagrees with his orders he must choose between his mission and his new-found place among the Na'vi. In the end, he fights for what he believes in, siding with the natives. Avatar was a highly-anticipated film because of the high budget and new techniques used with 3D and CGI. James Cameron used new technology along with new filming techniques hand n hand to develop a new movie experience. He delivered a film with never before used technology allowing for great advancement in the film industry. He was able to see in real time the actors in the digital world and make adjustments accordingly allowing for better motion and action capture within each scene. Lighting Techniques played a major role in giving life and realism to the jungle that is Pandora. Even though Pandora is computer generated Fiore used lighting to breathe life into an animated world illuminating all the qualities of the beautiful nature Pandora has to offer. By creating realistic lighting shining down into the nature surrounding the actors and highlighting the natural beauty around theme Fiore created some of the most vibrant and mesmerizing images of a virtual jungle.\n",
            "\n",
            "There can be said there are many themes within the film Avatar, but the most prevalent would be the threat of modernization against nature. Another film with a similar theme is Disney's Pocahontas. In Pocahontas, this theme is not overly shadowed and meddled by the time restraint and simplicity of the story line so it is better understood. John Smith is sent to scope out a native colony for another precious metal gold on behalf of the English empire.\n",

May be when i think that i like this movie i might be fooling myself?

I find myself not completely agreeing with either side but I do believe that it's got far to much um warranted hate. The main hate from this movie comes from that fact that it's got a few blatant similarities to other movies and it's probably this films greatest short coming but it doesn't kill the films it got far to much good in it for it to be considered bad. But one other slight negative with the film is the fact that Sam Worthington is a but bland in this film he just never really stands out or does anything other than what he's required to. But Zoe Saldana is amazing in this film she just completely invests herself in this character and is the greatest motion capture performance since Andy Serkis in Lord of The Rings. The one thing that no one can call derivative in this film is the world of Pandora it is incredible the landscapes look incredible and the Nav'i look incredible they're culture is interesting and entertaining to watch grow. The action sequences look amazing and you feel the scale of these two races fighting each other only through Cameron's direction. In all honesty there's nothing particularly special about Stephen Langs villain but he's incredibly entertaining and holds his own in the battle scenes.\n",
            "\n",
            "I hate the fact that so many people have turned on this movie when James Cameron so clearly poured his heart and soul into it. It looks incredible and has mostly great performances and is truly a movie that (even though similar to others) is like nothing I've ever seen before.\n",

            "\n",
            "1= This movie is visually stunning right from the beginning not only visually stunning but also beautiful, you could also pause the movie at any point and your TV could be doubled as a over sized picture frame.\n",
            "\n",
            "2= Not only this movie allows you to understand the Avatar Universe early but it also makes it easy for you to understand the Avatar Universe.\n",
            "\n",
            "3= The plot from the movie to me feels almost like it could be a Star Trek Movie (NOT JJ ABREMS REBOOT). Of curse I'm talking about the classic Star Trek Movies.\n",
            "\n",
            "4= There is an Alien creature in the movie that kind of looks like of an Alien Xenomorph.\n",
            "\n",
            "5= The Pandora Planet also an African Jungle Amazon feel an look to it. The reason I found that interesting is because that is all I was thinking about while I was watching the movies as to the regards of the sitting in which the movie takes place.\n",
            "\n",
            "6= As I was watching the movie I feel that the over all message of the movie is Cultural Understanding, and Cultural Acceptance more Understanding than Acceptance. Which goes along with my Statement from above. About the movie feeling like an idea for a Classic Star Trek Movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "7= In addition as I was watching the movie I was constantly reminded of the metaphor of the old West in which the people in the West invade and attack the Native Americans but in space. In this case the Humans are the Western Invaders, and the Na'vi are the Native Americans.\n",
            "\n",
            "8= The VO (Voice Over) in the movie is really great, it is told in the format of a Video Diary, and I'm not just talking about Jack the main character telling us what's going in the terms of his mission, but also in the terms of his changing feelings through out the movie and what is he planing what to do. And it's not your typical Video Diary VO either, it's not just VO in the beginning to open the movie and at the same time explain to us the audience what the world of Pandora is. And another VO at the end to close the movie up and at the same time to show what the effects of climax events had on both sides. No it's not like that at all, Jack the main character constantly provides his VO in his POV so it truly becomes a Video Dairy, and not just away for us the audience to know what is going on. And I like that it gives you a sense of feeling that the audience is a character in the movie, and that the main character Jack is constantly reporting back to you the audience in Video Diary format. Like you are an government official back on earth or something. I like movies that have that, it's too bad that not more movies have that.\n",
            "\n",
            "9= Another thing I have noticed while watching the movie is that the main bases for the Na'vi Cutler, is being one with Nature. Now the Na'vi are literally one with Nature, but it got me thinking maybe humans should be with one with Nature. I'm talking MORE than JUST camping and hugging trees, no I'm talking about NOT holding innocent animals captive and NOT shooting innocent animals just for the sport of it. I think the only justly reasons to kill an animal is, A when you are protecting your self, and B when you need you need food while in nature. For me those are the ONLY two justly reasons to kill an animal(s), and the like. So in short I think we should try and take a page from the Na'vi Cutler's book and try and coexist with animals, because if we don't then I would agree with Agent Smith in the first Matrix movie when he said that Humans are nothing but a Diseases Plague a Cancer for this planet. I don't know about you but the very idea bring compered to an Infection is uneasy to me to say the least.\n",

            "\n",
            "11= The Soundtrack. Not only it's the one of the best Soundtracks I have heard in any movie, but also the Soundtrack helps you care about the characters and what's going on at that point in time in the movie. But also at one point in the movie I thought the Soundtrack was so good I not only thought to myself that I got to get this Soundtrack, but also some of the music for this movie is so relaxing it puts you in a Meditative State at least it did for me. And on top of all that the Soundtrack for this movie I found that it also helps you get invested in more than just the characters in the movie but it also gets you invested in the movie as a whole, on what is happening at that point in the movie on what is about to happen, etc.\n",
            "\n",
            "CS= Now the movie is not perfect I did have some minor problems in it, such as the Climax fight. And I have to admit at some parts it's really predictable like predicting who the real villain is early on in the movie. And finally I'm not sure this movie really needs a sequel, much less multiple sequels, to me it wraps everything up nicely. The only reason to make sequel(s) to this movies is I'm sorry to say Greed \n",

            "311 ) James Cameron's long awaited return to cinema! His first feature film since Titanic. Cameron has always been a filmmaker who brings something new, so of course the hype was really high for his next film. And information of what Avatar was going to be just kept increasing everyone's anticipation for it. This looked like something different. Cameron has long been a favourite filmmaker for me. Terminator 1 & 2 are definitely on my list of best movies ever. So did it live up? Well Avatar is a great movie. It is not an amazing one. The expression style over substance has been used many times and by me before but Avatar is exactly that. Cameron ones again takes the special effects to new heights and also reintroduced 3D to cinema. Technically the visuals are a masterpiece one could say. Also the design and creativity of the world and creatures is great. Not on Star Wars like levels but Avatar looks pretty much flawless. The whole movie has this very epic theme to it. The action is also great as should be expected. It's not as mind-blowing as his Terminator movies or as intense as Aliens or as ridiculously (in an entertaining way) as in True Lies. But Avatar is better than most released at the same time. However, it is underneath this brilliant surface that the flaws are. The story is Avatars weakest part. It totally lacks in originality. It borrows heavily from many different sources. I feel that even if one has not seen a lot of movies Avatar is unfortunately very predictable. You can early sense where the story is going. It is a story that entertains rather than surprises. It is the writing that lacks. Cameron's earlier movies had great dialogue and memorable quotes. Avatar honestly doesn't have those. And then we have the actors. Unfortunately, if I shall be honest Sam Worthington is not a charismatic actor. But it's not all his fault. Cameron can create amazing characters but here they feel thin. None of the actors here are bad but their characters are weakly written. The characters have this predictable feel too them in the same way as the plot. Not bad in any way just nothing more than pretty standard. All this said sounds so negative, the problem is just that I guess my demands on James Cameron are so high. Avatar is a very good and greatly entertaining movie. Technically amazing but when you see past the brilliant effects this is not the masterpiece some were expecting and some are claiming. 8/10. \n",

            "312 ) As a prolific reviewer here, I have on many occasions encountered what I call \"first release shock.\" Essentially a film so off-the-beaten-path, so unique, so different that, instead of appreciating it for what it is, initial viewers go into a sort of shock and become numb to what they are watching.\n",
            "\n",
            "This film is the poster child for that syndrome. On its own, it is one of the most daring, best written, best acted, best SFX'd, films of all time. It comes from a man (Cameron) who is known for blockbusters, but this is easily his greatest work.\n",
            "\n",
            "This film should rate a perfect score regardless of the rating system. But as explained above initial viewers did not know what to make of it. And the cost of the film became an issue for the studio when the numbers failed to meet expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is not the job of the reviewer to worry about studio receipts. The job of the reviewer is identify brilliance and recommend it. See it six or seven times, it just gets better. One of the greatest films of all time and also timeless. \n",

            "313 ) After hearing about this movie for almost 7 years, I've finally watched this and think its awesome. It has great visual effects, a fine cast and an amazing soundtrack. I also like this movie better then Titanic. I mean it has some sad scenes in it, but is much more powerful then Titanic. Its also sort of like the animated film Ferngully the Last Rain-forest, but with more action. It also does have an environmental message that we need to protect all the rain- forests. I think the best scene in this movie was the battle sequence between both the Earthlings and the Na'vi and the hero Jake Sully against the villain Colonel Miles Quaritch. I also like the flying sequences in the movie when Jake and Neytiri were flying those bird like creatures all over Pandora. In the end after the great big battle between the humans and Na'vi, most humans were exiled from Pandora back to Earth never to return. Some however were allowed to stay cause they respected Pandora's environment. Jake also became a member of the Na'vi society and all's well that ends well. Awesome movie here and I so recommend this to other people who have not seen it. It also reminds me of Star Wars a little and I don't care what James Cameron thinks of The Force Awakens cause that's still my most favorite movie of all time. \n",

            "314 ) Lovely movie.There was an energy, there was an effort put into every moment of the movie. No scene went on too long, no plot holes fell through. It was the comic, come alive Just got back from my second viewing of Avatar in the stunning Max 3D and it was even better this time around. I won't go into the story line as you probably already have an idea of this and i don't want to add any spoilers. The storyline itself is simple but not unintelligent and keeps you gripped from start to finish. There is lots of action, battle scenes, sci fie, and a love story to keep you occupied. The special effects are amazing and the attention to detail is brilliant but this is not just a Fox showpiece like 2012 was, there is depth to avatar. I just could not see how anyone could dislike this, the 2 and a half hours drifted by and left me wanting more.

            "315 ) Avatar is a science fantasy for the ages, an instant cult-classic that is endearingly beautiful in nearly any way you look at it. It visually raised the bar far, far beyond anything cinema had done prior, introducing the world's audiences to an era of virtual cinematography unparalleled to any other motion-picture period, bar none.\n",
            "\n",
            "Avatar is a philosophical film that explores the timeless notion of a higher power, and our position as the 'dominant' species. The planet of visitation known only as 'Pandora' parallels our world in many ways, the film grips the viewer and asks, \"who's really the alien? Who's really the outsider?\" it shows man as an accursed being to any place he might dare to dwell; 'Pandora's box' reflecting the human temptation of the knowledge of life and death in the world, as stated in the Bible. Illustrating the clash between low consciousness (invasion force) and high consciousness (na'vi).\n",
            "\n",
            "The plot line is simplistic, yet manages to be exemplary. It demonstrates man's often uncanny detachment from the world around him, and predisposition to subduing the earth and making it an extension of his ego, as opposed to something to harmonise with, the saying \"wealth but at what cost?\" comes to mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "The plot line follows a paraplegic marine, (Sam Worthington) who is forced to fight between this notion of harmony, and the notion of fractal greed, it turns out that his physical inhibition (paraplegia) is surpassed by joining the 'higher' consciousness through leaving his body, perhaps alluding to how spiritualism is our escape from the prison of flesh we inhabit. \n",
            "\n",
            "316 ) Despite the film's incredible statistics, it lacks a certain amount of depth to them. At moments that were perhaps intended to move the audience are portrayed weakly while characters with high potential are trivialised by a lack of screen time. As a result, one may question whether it's high budget was worth the outcome. Although the advanced special effects are undeniably admirable and are perhaps what Avatar owes a lot of its success to, the impact of the story upon audiences was minimal, which is where i feel the movie loses most of its magic. It primarily falls to disappointing character development and a predictable plot at the cost of unbelievable graphics, which is unfortunate as it does introduce important political criticisms by highlighting the flaws within American foreign policy.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although this film has many credible elements including fantastic CGI and the creation of a seemingly new culture (the Na'vi language and hierarchy), it is let down by cliches and high predictability. For example, the rare material that they seek is named 'unobtainium', a ridiculously uninventive name. Moreover, every character seems to fall into very predictable categories: the cold businessman, the tough military leader, the devoted scientist. Similarly, the storyline and character development were easily foreseeable. Furthermore, the film mentions the network between the roots of the trees a number of times, and the danger that this might have upon the military who are attacking Pandora. However, this concept seems to be dropped and ignored, almost as if the director gave up on the idea. Cameron's inconsistency in the film is further evident by the way the Na'vi managed to speak half in perfect English and then seemed to forget it, why these creatures would have any interest in learning a human language is also debatable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, I believe this film has phenomenal potential, if a more imaginiative storyline was introduced with more complex undertones, characters and inferences it would be treated with far more appreciation.

It won't exactly be timeless, though it will be well known for its box office success for a long time to come. Maybe some people get annoyed by the blatant Eco-friendly intent that goes with this movie, but making something that millions of people are going to see pertain to some social issues is not the worst thing in the world.\n",

If you're more of a rom-com or drama type of person, I probably don't need to tell you to steer clear of this. But for action fans, there are not many places you'll find cooler action set pieces than here. Just watching the exotic life of the Navi is worth the ticket price, not to mention their fantastic combative abilities and those of the creatures they interact with. There are very few slow parts, and these are pretty brief and many setup things that payoff later.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, there are some deeper concepts to be found if you care to look. Basically, the movie serves as a macrocosm of what has happened throughout human history. A more advanced society wants various things that a weaker one can provide, namely materials, territory, commercial benefits, and scientific research. All of these desires are present throughout Avatar, and we see all of them play tug-of-war with Jake, so to speak.\n",
            "\n",
            "Of course, the social commentary wasn't the only thing that sticks out in this movie. Most noteworthy are the computer graphics and visuals. Not all of the alien species look terribly realistic (mostly those dog types Jake fights his first night in the forest), but all look sharp and clear. It's all very colorful and more than a little weird-looking. This, coupled with the incredible sci-fi action sequences made it an ideal movie to see in theaters.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, for visual spectacle to do any good, it has to tell a good story. You could argue that the story is weak. The narrative is coherent and there aren't any plot holes that stick out, but there are some story elements that feel \"cheap\". It's science fiction, which means the writers and story artists can just create some new rule for their universe if they have a story problem. A good example of this is when Jake prays to Eywa to assist the Navi in their fight against the humans, and all of nature is suddenly out in force for the climatic battle. Despite this, the characters are done pretty well. This doesn't mean they will necessarily be appealing, but they all have a well-defined goal, get introduced distinctly, and express what they want Jake to do for them so that we care about what they want. Now, this doesn't mean that each character has a believable or likable personality, because some of them don't. Jake makes a pretty good protagonist; a little generic, but with enough personality and motive and emotion to give him depth and make us root for him.\n",

I mean people were the same when Titanic was released; a lot of people called it overrated but that didn't stop it from winning 11 Oscars and being called a masterpiece by many others.

In fact, you might say that Avatar is more about special effects, but it just shows that anybody can become a hero no matter who they are. I also enjoy Zoe Saldana as Neytiri and Avatar (as well as 2009's Star Trek) made her a superstar and the romance between her and Jake Sully. And the battle scenes are just as epic as battles scenes in movies like The Lord of the Rings or Braveheart. And I like like the dramatic moments as well.\n",

The man who gave us Sci-Fi classics like 'The Terminator', 'T2: Judgement Day' and 'Aliens' giving us his most ambitious piece yet. But for all its visual grandeur, its technical marvel, its fine detail, Avatar ends up being a disheartening failure. Why? Because it makes the fatal mistake of completely ignoring the two things that are crucial in any film, story and character.\n",

Well so far so good, there's at least some creativity. All that disappears quickly. We learn that the military and business tycoons are there to take a valuable material called Unobtainium (oh how do they come up with this stuff). I'm so sick of these lazy plots that have suits taking what isn't there's. We get the message they're hammering us with, leave the indigenous people and their land alone. Of course Jake is persuaded by Colonel Quaritch to deliver information and secrets about the Na'vi directly to him so he can figure out their weakness in exchange for the spinal surgery Jake needs.\n",

Oh wait, I have in 'Dances with Wolves', 'Pocahontas' and 'The Last Samurai' to name but a few. It is exactly the same story as all of these. It has the same set-up, it follows the same beats, it has the same character motivations, and it even has the same preachy moral lesson. The white man comes to conquer, but the main character can't fight against the culture he initially dislikes but grows to care for. There is not a single moment in the film where I didn't know what was going to happen next. For all the money spent why couldn't they write a better story?\n",

There isn't even a reason for them to like each other. The only reason Neytiri changes her mind is because some kind of sprite lands on him and that's a sign that he has a good heart. Sadly the film is littered with convenient and mystical hogwash like that which is never looked at in any detail. It's fair enough that the film has its own mythology, but at least try to give some meaning. The film suffers badly from lack of explanation. Like why are the military so fixed on destroying the planet to gain the material when it's clear that the Na'vi can be befriended with relative ease? It is basically because we need some villains and those mean humans will do just fine.\n",

Sam Worthington's agent deserves a medal for getting one of the blandest, most expressionless, cardboard cut-out actors ever to grace the screen to helm a film of this magnitude. It boggles my mind as to how insipid an actor he is. Jake as a character isn't very interesting but there are countless actors who could of at least brought something to the role. Zoe Saldana suffers too, but that's mainly because Neytiri is a totally unlikeable and irritating character. You even have good actors like Sigourney Weaver and Stephen Lang wasted in cliched roles as the plucky scientist and the colonel blinded by stupidity. In a film like this we need characters that are either relatable or interesting in order to keep them from being swamped. You'd think Cameron of all people would know this.\n",

This film is gorgeous. The textures, the colour scheme, the shades of light, the environment of Pandora, it all looks pretty incredible and I can see why it took so long to craft. The CGI both stands out on its own and blends with the live-action seamlessly. The Na'vi's design is a bit conventional, but again the detail gone into creating them is there for all to see. The visuals truly are the films only outstanding feature. The same can't be said of the action sequences even though they're are decently staged and can get suitably intense, they're nowhere near as imaginative or gripping as they could have been. That's partly because you don't care who lives or dies.\n",

Something that is so reliant on its visual brilliance that without it there is nothing to offer. How could someone as talented as Cameron create a story that is so cliche riddled and unengaging? In many ways the film's success is disappointing. It's telling filmmakers that we want more films where the stories and characters can be as basic as possible as long as we get some impressive visuals, where we value style over substance. I want style, but I also want a film that I can be invested in and where I care about what happens. Avatar failed to provide this on any level. \n",

Pandora is where Na'vi people who has blue skin and big yellow eyes live in the harmony with mother goddess called Eywa. However, the atmosphere is toxic for human. In order to explore Pandora, the scientists create a Na'vi body called Avatar. By using that body, human could live and act normally in Pandora. Jake Sully is one of the first persons who join in this experiment. The group tries to gather the Na'vi's intelligence about plants and the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. However, after being rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi and live with the Na'vi more than three months, Jake feel sympathize to them. He cooperates with the Na'vi to prevent them from attacking by human. This movie is directed by James Camaron. He cherishes this movie from his childhood for more than ten years. This movie uses many music, sound tracks and visual effects such as 3-D fusion camera and the virtual camera systems. This makes audiences who watch it in 3-D form feel like they live in a completely different world. This technique helps them feel how the beautiful and amazing Pandora is and look like the Na'vi stand in front of them.

I am sure that the actress the producer and the director worked so hard to make this film and they are highly successful.The story of the film was amazing and out of imagination.

Plots from previous movies or stories have been used and re- used over and over again and we don't complain about many of them being ripped off. Shakespeare has been redone countless times and there is something new with each retelling of his work. With the retelling of Dances With Wolves via Avatar we have a Dances With Wolves for a new generation.

It's a moon of a planet in another galaxy that seems to bring our fantasies to life with foreign lifeforms beyond our imaginations - monkeys with four arms, crossbreed lifeforms that seem to combine horses with zebras, giant flying creatures that we could probably only compare to pterodactyls, and the list goes on. The plants in this universe are strange and beautiful in their own way as well. Everything on the moon seems to have a blue or green tint to it, practically force- feeding the audience the idea that this world is supposed to represent a sort of Eden. The most notable factor of this world is the human-like creatures labeled as the Na'vi can literally connect with many of the animals as well as their sacred tree through a link that ironically resembles the way digital technologies connect in this day and age. Such a world and the connection between the natives and nature preach heavily for environmentalist movements. Finally, we have to remember this world was created with digital rendering, and the world is nothing short of beautiful.\n",

Let's look at various ridiculous aspects of Avatar. The name of the mineral the United States businessman (played by Ribisi) is looking for is Unobtainium. Surprisingly, that is not a joke. The head of the military sanction is a one-dimensional character set out only on destroying the Na'vi since they're \"savages\" (according to his cheesy monologue at the start of the movie) and so that his superiors can get their hands on the Unobtainium. He trusts Sully and believes he will report to him since he used to be a marine and makes a promise to get him his real legs back - that is before his use of the Avatar allows him to enjoy running again. Dialogue coming from this character as well as from Sully and even Sigourney Weaver's character are laughable at moments, making us ask why Cameron didn't consult many co-writers.\n",

We cheer for Sully and the Na'vi in the climactic battle within the film which lives up to other great action sequences in recent years even if most of it is CGI, though this film requires heavy use of CGI throughout, so why would the action be any different?\n",

It has great visual effects, a great story, awesome romance, action, acting, and directing. When I first saw it, I was thirteen years old and it gripped me. It made me laugh. It made me cry. It made my heart pump. It brought about so many different emotions that are impossible to describe with words. If you haven't seen this movie, your life is automatically worse than everyone else who has. That is how good this movie is. I have seen it thirty seven times now and every time has been just as good as the last, save for the first viewing which was absolutely amazing.

It is a visually striking science fiction masterpiece about the uniting of lifestyles. Jake Scully is an injured ex-marine who is transformed into an Avatar. This process involves his mind in an alien body. His mission is to travel to Pandora and drive out the alien lifeforms but he ends up adapting and falling in love both. Director James Cameron creates a tremendous world of creatures and vegetation that ranks it as his greatest achievement. That is quite the accomplishment considering that his resume consists of such films as Titanic and The Terminator. Sam Worthington plays Scully who questions his mission especially when his targets seem peaceful. Zoe Saldana plays the skillful Neytiri who struggles to preserve life and nature but is thrust into forbidden romance and a fight for survival. Sigourney Weaver plays one of Scully's contacts who decides to experience the lifestyle with him despite the consequences that arise. Stephen Lang plays a ruthless Colonel who pushes ahead with plans of destruction that forces Scully to wage war against him. Michelle Rodriguez plays a fighter pilot in a role that seems tailor made for her and she excels at. Fantastic eye candy masterpiece about preserving culture. Score: 10 / 10 \n",

To jump right in, this movie has the best cinematography in cinematic history. This film is absolutely beautiful. The wide shots of Pandora and all of the wildlife sucks you in every time you watch it. The directing is also good, which is expected of James Cameron. The editing is good, which is obvious due to this movie being in production for 12 years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The biggest negative starts with the acting. However, only in one spot. Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Michelle Rodriguez, and Stephen Lang do amazing in their roles, and make set the tone for the acting. However, the tone is ripped down by the main role, played by Sam Worthington. For anyone who's seen Clash of the Titans or Terminator Salvation, you know that Sam Worthington isn't a good actor. He actually does better in this film that the others mentioned, but he still doesn't do well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another nit picky negative is the symbolism for the movie Dances With Wolves. I think that Dances With Wolves is a very good film, and many aspects of this movie come from that of Dances With Wolves. However, nobody can call it a direct copy, just because there are similarities. Another positive is the score. The score for this film is vigorous. Props to James Horner, one of the best movie composers out there, for the score. Some of the scenes where Jake is flying on his Ikran, the pounding score enthralls me every time I watch it. This also leads me to the topic of rewatchability. I've watched this movie plenty of times, and it doesn't really get old. That is a big positive for this film.\n",

As an Avatar, a human mind in an alien body, he finds himself torn between two worlds, in a desperate fight for his own survival and that of the indigenous people. It might be more impressive on a technical level than as a piece of storytelling, but Avatar reaffirms James Cameron's singular gift for imaginative, absorbing film-making. Also Planet Pandora's plant and animal life is done with a wonder that has been often absent from fiction screens. \n",

            "\n",
            "Sigourney Weaver, who in my eyes is one of the greatest actresses I've ever seen - she's definitely in the top ten, perhaps even top five - made Grace Augustine a snarky, feisty and rather rude woman who was hiding a loving, maternal side as well as a great deal of emotional pain, particularly in regards to the destruction of her school. By the way, if you want to fully appreciate Sigourney's performance in this movie, you need to see Grace's discussion with Jake about the school and that is only shown in the special edition.\n",
            "\n",
            "I've seen Sam Worthington in Clash of the Titans and Wrath of the Titans, but he was at his finest in Avatar, making Jake Sully into a sarcastic and fierce warrior who also had a childish wonder for the world around him. You also see Jake develop throughout the movie. Initially he seems like a \"dumb grunt\" but grows into a charismatic leader. His love for Neytiri felt very genuine, thanks to the excellent chemistry between Sam and Zoey.\n",

            "I wouldn't put Zoey Saldana as high as Sigourney Weaver on my list of most talented actresses, but she still did impressive work as the feisty Neytiri. If I had to criticize her, I'd say she was just a little over-the-top when Neytiri found out that Jake was a spy and when she was crying over her father. However to be fair, Neytiri was devastated in both of those scenes and it's perfectly in character for her to lash out when she's angry or distraught, so it was still a great performance. Despite being slightly over-the-top in those two scenes, Zoey proved that she is still capable of subtlety and I'm a guy who appreciates subtlety in a performance. For example there was Neytiri's little disapproving glance at Tsu'tey when Jake was about to catch his Ikran, her playful smile when Jake deliberately flew too close to her or the vulnerable look in her eyes when Jake acknowledged that Peyral was a good hunter. Regardless of whether Zoey's as good as Sigourney or not, she still made Neytiri my favourite character in the entire movie.\n",

Although not a deep character, Stephan Lang's performance was so strong that the simplicity of Quaritch doesn't really matter to me.\n",

            "I haven't seen many movies starring Michelle Rodriguez - actually I'm not sure if I've seen her in any films outside of Avatar - but she was an excellent choice to play Trudy Chacon. From what I know of her, Michelle is most comfortable in the role of tough and feisty women so she fitted Trudy's character very well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those six were the greatest performances in the movie but I'll also give credit to CCH Pounder, Wes Studi, Laz Alonso and Joel David Moore; all of them did great jobs. Dileep Rao and Matt Gerald were rather forgettable but to be fair, their roles were too small for us to really see how skilled they are. However out of the two of them, Matt put on a better performance with what he had to work with.\n",
            "\n",
            "The storyline is rather simple - my younger brother has described it as basically Pocahontas with blue aliens - but that in no way cheapens the experience. Sometimes a simple storyline is the greatest storyline. It depends on how it's told and this story is told extremely well so the predictability of the plot didn't bother me. Furthermore quite a few likable and/or important characters die in this film, showing that Cameron is not afraid to show the brutal reality of war.\n",

            "\n",
            "Another thing to mention is that the special effects are magnificent. Admittedly, I'm no expert on special effects but the Na'vi, animals and plants all look incredibly realistic. If I'm not mistaken, Cameron had ideas for this film about a decade before it came out but waited until technology was more advanced in order to make it as realistic as possible. That was a wise decision and another sign of the passion and dedication he had for this movie.\n",

Yeah, it just didn't really do anything for me. I agree, the graphics are stunning. If you want to get sucked into this world with the CGI and the animation of all the animals, go see this movie because you will be pleased. But the reason this didn't really work for me is the story. It's a story that's been seen a million times before. Dances with Wolves and Pocahontas did this story, and it was old back then. I know a lot of people really liked this movie for it's graphics, but personally I have to be engrossed in the story to be engrossed in the movie. I also think that the villains were weakly developed. They're just the generic bad buys. So personally I'm not a fan, but that doesn't mean you won't be. \n",

However, the story of a tribe that is endangered and fights to protect its environment and habitat is so old and beaten. I got no sense of who the characters are. The storyline is so thin, it is almost invisible. I also did not like how the animated characters looked like a hybrid of a lizard an human being. I don't know what James Cameron was thinking when he developed the faces of those creatures. I believe this plays really well into the narrative of the environmentalists. However, I don't find the parallels with the real world especially from the perspective of how human beings heavily rely on fossil fuels for survival and for everything in their daily lives. \n",

As he explores this biological wonderland with the innocence of a child, Jake's long blue avatar makes us think of Adam in Eden, especially when he samples an attractive piece of fruit offered to him by his 'Eve'. The forest even has its own special tree of spiritual significance, the Tree of Souls. The Eden parallels have limits things here eat each other, and the Na'vi hunt animals.

The military have made a base on Pandora and create Avatars that Jake and other scientists control to live with Na'vi. The film explores how different groups treat the environment and show how it is significant in sustaining life. As the film progresses it shows how all living organisms form some sort of symbiotic relationship. The Na'vi calls the environment and the spirit that controls everything Eywa. Eywa connects every living thing and gives reason to each event. The Na'vi connect to Eywa by some sort of neuron connection. This connection allows them to feel what Eywa feels and connect and understand other organisms. In comparison the Humans destroy the environment and are extremely aggressive. They have no connection to their environment and the environment of others as they destroy whatever they want for their own benefit. The film also explores how an organism's soul is precious and shows that one event has a significant event on another. The film contains many shots that show how beautiful the environment is and uses its CGI to the fullest. The environments are beautiful, lush and glowing with colour. This allows the audience to appreciate the environment more and feel more anger against the humans for destroying it. It causes the audience to think about how this is a reality and humans are in fact destroying the environment.

            "Not only was the CGI and effects spectacular, the story plot was just as good. An example of that is how the characters progress emotionally. The first clip in the movie shows Jake Sully as a somewhat low life guy who picks fights in bars. Jake slowly starts changing his attitude as soon as he knows that his brother died and more importantly after he is introduced to the world of Pandora. We see that he has become more humane and emotionally connected, and less of a military type of rigid person. Of course, we don't see that immediately but rather throughout the movie.\n",

The combination of dragon-like creatures and Direhorses with Na'vi's riding both while battling flying machinery and robots, all give it a sense of out-most epic-ness. James Cameron has definitely set the bar for fictional movies and without a doubt other filmmakers are going to follow his footsteps one way or another.

And certainly not so for Avatar, a movie in which you have to practically be Indiana Jones to find fans of, at least on the internet. For all the technological innovations it brought upon the industry, it is a movie that not a lot of people seem to like. Basically, it is the answer to the question, \"What would LOTR's impact have been on the world if it had been disliked?\" When you say that you like this movie, the first thing that a lot of people say is that, \"But...don't you see that it's just Fern Gully (a movie that I first learned about by these comparisons), Pocahontas (Eh), and Dances With Wolves (a movie I like better than you and did not find that boring even though I watched the four-hour long version). It's not original.\" (Malice is not intended, but feel free to read that in the most whiny voice possible.) Yes, it is like those movies.

There are a certain amount of stories and elements that just stick close to peoples' hearts. And so those are repeated again and again. Not that this is a bad thing. I adore LOTR and many other movies that follow this formula. If you want to hate Avatar, fine, I don't care. It's not even my favorite thing with 'Avatar' in its name. But hate it for reasons that are more fully fleshed out than \"It ripped off X and Y.\" By the way, after you read this review, I highly recommend reading Joseph Campbell's' Monomyth if you haven't already.

The rest of the actors are good and are able to elevate a middling script (people don't watch Cameron movies for the writing, though in this, as in his other movies, it's fine) but they are not great.

The new world, their systems, their 'humans', the animals, the birds, a whole new language for God's sake! It is an amazing and out of the world piece of imagination, and I can't even begin to imagine how much of hard-work and dedication it must have required. It is the highest earning Hollywood film ever, an achievement fully deserved! Watching it for the third time in my life I went through the entire film with a smile on my face. A smile that one wears when you are really enjoying something, and I did every bit of just thinking that this dream-world is a product of someone's fantasies. It is the kind of film that I would stand up for at the end to clap in the theatre. The most impressive thing for me has to be its language.

This is what happened in real life in a lot of wars on earth, but now it's up to nature to help the people who haven't neglected their own planet, by building concrete and buildings, instead of letting nature do its job. Mankind literally stopped their planet from functioning how it was in the beginning times. It is impossible NOT to like this movie for its originality, and accurate representation of how earth would have looked like when people lived in peace with nature, instead of destroying it. Also when alien life forces attacked earth when they were one with nature. It is a beautiful thing. I would definitely recommend watching this movie with a clean mind, not judging everything, and just let emotion overwhelm you. Preemptive judgement ruins most experiences of movies, as people force themselves to watch it, just to ruin it for themselves. Such phenomenons can also be seen in modern media, Americans generally dislike Russia, and as a result, they find evidence hidden for any suspicious activities to blackmail that country, while they can blame any country for all the bad things they do, but don't. That's why I recommend everyone to form their own opinions, and not to be blinded by what other people say and do. \n",

            "356 ) While Avatar maybe doesn't deserve to be the film with biggest box-office record, it's not so much of a 'bad story, eye candy' film as it is made believed in other reviews. Avatar was truly a breakthrough in filmmaking almost comparable to what Star Wars did in 1977, from the visual effects aspect of filmmaking. The motion-capture technology and advanced rendering sistem was nearly invented with this film, and is now commonly used in many films. And this movie is one of the few ones that has no CGI flaw in nearly 3 hours almost entirely shot in CGI, which is quite outstanding. We're introduced to a visually appealing world, really wonderful and also realistic (thanks to the mentioned advanced visuals). The opposite military-sci-fi technology of men makes the whole film unique. Story wise, it almost seems a natives vs white explorers story, just with aliens versus humans, and some misticism of different sorts. The existence of the dragon-like creatures makes the whole thing get a fantasy touch too. Plus we have some good old sci-fi, with the concept of Avatars. Really, this movie has a quite unique merging of different concepts. Casting worked perfectly to me, and so did direction. The ambientalist/freedom message is though kinda obvious, but it's also not as important as it might seem in order to enjoy the film. I really enjoyed the depiction of battles as well. Overall, an at least once must see film. \n",

People need to start to be flexible, and stop being to sensitive and ruthless in their criticism. As for avatar, well this is what 3D was invented for. The joy in not only in enjoying 3D, but in enjoying Pandora, experience it.How often do we look at the beautiful scenery of nature and think of Holidaying there. The world Pandora is porn for a nature poet. Many complain that the story is too simple, seen a lot of times, and nothing new. That's true. But there is a reason for that, Avatar isn't about interaction of characters among themselves, it's about the characters interacting the world for you. That's the reason why the story is kept simple on purpose, for the audience to enjoy the visual delight. Also it is kept simple so that the message is delivered quite loud and you don't reminisce on any convolution(or lack of) in the story. Critics would cut few marks for so simple story, but the thing is it's not about what the story is,it's about how it is delivered and Avatar scores full marks on it.It sure doesn't feel the same when watched in 2D or on television and it's repeat watch value dies after a couple of times. Background score too is simple but very well made-specifically-for-the- movie. \n",

            "After four years of the film, many articles and studies have been written about the film's religious symbolism and relationship with Hinduism etc. However, I was surprised that nobody (as far as I searched) noticed that the attack of Colonel Quaritch to destroy Na'vi holiest site \"the tree of souls\" resembles the very well-known story in the Arab and Muslim history of the attack of Abraha The ruler of Yemen to destroy the Arab's most sacred site \"Kaaba\" in city Mecca around year 570. As it is depicted in Muslim history, Abraha led a massive army which was headed by an elephant. His aim was to destroy Arab's spiritual centre so that he can rule them. Abraha's attack failed because the \"nature\" has acted in favour of the defence of Kaaba where the elephant and horses in Abraha's army refused to enter Mecca, and enormous group of birds attacked the army by throwing stones on them. This story is important for Muslims since it was mentioned in the Quran and reaffirms the sacredness of Mecca.\n",

Eywa (the Na'vi Goddess) triggered an attack by Pandora's animals against the army both on the ground and in the sky. In fact, the attack of Tendrils and Toruks (the flying animals) scene reminded me instantly of the story of birds attacking Abraha's army.

When a guy who has lost his legs jumps in joy we feel man I would have done that too. When a person with his courage has won the trust of many and feels to lose it then he would do anything to get it back. Each nuance was stunning and oozing in beauty and splendor. A new world PANDORRA has been created and AVATAR makes you feel right there, you can touch those ferns, those plants, those wild animals (or monsters, I can't term them).

In my Opinion the only negative things is its long running time to film, James said that is due to the development and innovation of modern graphics that will not go down in history as fast, considering that it would be an extraordinary film should have a unique graphic, not only based in the graphics but it seems to me is one of the few movies that combine action with a story without mistakes.

The amount of skills and technology involved to put this movie together is a big step forward. Compared to the stuff that Robert Zemeckis does, the big difference is the faces. James Cameron brings real emotions to his CGI characters that is still missing from Zemeckis. The world of Pandora looks amazing and lush. It has enough fantasy and realism. It represented a new high point of 3D. It is a visual triumph. \n",

            "365 ) I was cajoled into writing this review by the numerous unjust critiques of this movie. People these days expect a lot of complexity in the script, in editing, camera handling and the whole movie-making process. Even when simplicity has vastly greater effect. While the story might seem cliched, I think the idea was beautifully executed and the message conveyed was clear. Imagine a confluence of both physical and metaphysical aspects of nature, of spiritual and material life, of politics and imperialism; I think the movie couldn't have been more profound and so legible that even kids could comprehend. And as you delve, you realize just why Cameron is one of the greatest directors of all time. This is what dreams are like, not those from Inception. \n",

Writer, editor, producer, and director James Cameron uses a good ensemble cast which includes Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Michelle Rodriguez, Stephen Lang, Giovanni Ribisi, and the legendary Sigourney Weaver. Avatar had all the perfect ingredients for a science fiction epic. The visual effects to this movie are stunning, the cinematography is magnificent. the art direction is fantastic, and even the action sequences are just awesome. Also even the acting is perfect for a science fiction film, Sam Worthington gives the best performance of his career in James Cameron's best film yet.

            "368 )  Sir Laurence Olivier's film, with Maggie Smith, among other renowned actors, was a film with a script full of magic and fantasy, where the gods participate and have the role that is believed in Ancient Greece. In the new film, it is the same classic Hollywood mistake where the Greeks hate the gods. Perseus hates his father Zeuz, hates all the gods because they punish the men, and from there we go on a bad road. Zeuz can do whatever he wants, he is the creator of everything, therefore, he knows the fate of all men, of all Gods and can control it. I cannot believe that with the special effects we have, we have so bad stories that make the movies do not get that attraction of the viewer. I did not understand because there is no such respect from the original film for the creation of the new, tease the owl, pegasus now comes in black, kraken is a turtle with tentacles, I think the best thing about the movie is Medusa. In short this movie is a disaster. \n",

            "369 ) This is yet another remake of an old movie that, for some reason, has fallen by the wayside. I've never seen the original so I'm not the best person to compare. The film essentially tells the Greek myth of Perseus. The cast is led by Sam Worthington, who did a satisfying job in the action scenes but was unable to concede some psychological depth to his character. Much better on that was Liam Neeson, who played Zeus, or even Ralph Fiennes, who gave life to the grudging Hades in a way that makes clear that he was uncomfortable with his character. In fact, I was wondering if any resemblance between this Hades and Lord Voldemort was mere coincidence or whether Fiennes recycled into the mythical character the voice and manners of the villain of the Harry Potter franchise. But this can even be forgiven when we observe the performance of Gemma Arterton, unable to move a muscle of the face. Her character looks like a dead doll.\n",

When will filmmakers finally understand that a lot of CGI is not enough to make a good movie? Even if it's good CGI, that's never enough! The screenwriters also failed, as the script is absolutely saltless and made the movie insipid. Nothing that is insipid tastes good. It takes salt, seasoning, and this is done, at least in the movies, with emotion and depth. This movie can even entertain us well, it really manages to do it. But it had everything to be even better if the director and writers had worked harder. \n",

            "370 )  This movie is interesting. It diverges far from it's source materiel, and takes a radically different route. It ditches the whole believe and follow your parents faith, and instead toys around with some deeper concepts. Enter Perseus. Perseus has led a hard life, his adoptive family have struggled to catch enough fish to eat, and storms regularly claim people's lives. When Perseus loses his family to a storm, his disappointment for the gods becomes hatred. King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia's army finds him and brings him to their city. There, the populace has become heathens, resenting their gods and defacing the temples and statues that are devoted to them. The queen claims her daughter is prettier and more attractive than the goddess Aphrodite. Zeus's brother, the embodiment of evil and Greek equivalent to Satan, the misanthropic hades, is given permission to spread mayhem with his pet, the kracken,an immense beast with virtually no shortcomings, by Zeus, as punishment for humanity's defiance. However, if Andromeda is fed to the kracken, the monster will become pacified, and refrain from exterminating the human race. Perseus realizes that Zeus is his father, who impregnated a human. His biological mother was killed by her human husband, but not before giving birth to Perseus. Questing across the lands in a bid to find the means to defeat the kracken, Perseus frequently is offered help from his heavenly parent, yet refuses his pity. He much prefers justice and care for his fellow humans, and would rather die among them than live forever in heaven. Throughout his quest, battling many nightmarish creatures, he barely scrapes through, yet never asks for any help from the gods. His morality was above the gods who created him, and their threats and the massacres they carry out on humans never intimidate him into submitting to them. It is only later in the movie does Zeus soften up, and Perseus admit he loves him, but he never allows himself to mould his own morality around Zeus, or depend on him as a guide. Perseus doesn't even need the threat of hell and reward of mount Olympus, or heaven, to dictate who he his. He sticks to his own morality, and aspires to help his fellow humans, whether the gods approve or not. He is even offered advantages from Zeus, that would rise him above the mortal humans, yet he refuses them. This movie definitely paints freethinking in a positive light. Without needing faith, Perseus remained kind, caring, tough, brave, and well-rounded. He still learned to love the gods, and respect them, but never relied on or allowed them to dictate him. Interesting ideas stemmed from this movie. Gods being reliant on, and friendly with the very demon who punishes defiant humans, and the fact gods need prayers to survive, or they die, are not to be overlooked. Religious and atheistic people should definitely gives this one a watch. \n",

This 2010 film is also not a carbon copy of the 1981 film, just like other \"remakes\" they have changes to create a variant instead of exact duplicates.

I should have known better after the good reviews were mostly from people who could barely write or spell, even passably, and couldn't use the spellcheck provided right HERE in this review window lol. MY excuse is that I was visiting relatives and they didn't have much I wanted to see. This is just a terrible Hollywood blockbuster designed to separate pre-teens, teens, and young adults from their cash. This POS movie had a sinful budget of $125mil with a $65mil opening weekend (US). That is just totally sad and the only redeeming thing about it is that it provided a ton of jobs, esp in places like Ethiopia. I have no respect for the big names in this. If they still have to work at all at this point, well, something is terribly wrong. Needless to say, there is NO real character development, acting phoned in, a totally embarrassing script, and only average CG (saw the DVD on a laptop, so worse on big screen). If you are thinking of watching this, don't. Go watch Thor again, Marvel has it all over Warner's in this dept. Only good thing about this movie was that I was able to sleep through most of it, only going back to skim and see if anything worth watching developed (it didn't); if I had been totally conscious, it would have been turned off after a half hour, at MOST. \n",

Generally speaking, a person carries emotional baggage with them that affects their decisions for good and for bad.

In his mind he needed to prove and to know and that he wasn't like the other gods and that a human could accomplish great deeds.

On the extreme end of that, those who cannot cope with their baggage may even descend into a lesser life lived. There is no one path for a person to take in order to work through this baggage and achieve happiness. It is accomplished through trial and error. One person may have to reconcile their feeling about a perceived inadequate parent while another person has to cut a monster's head off. It's all a matter of interpretation. \n",

Let me take you when I was 10 years old, this was the time I starting to love the art form know as film and understand it. And then saw the trailer for this movie and thought to myself \" this is going to suck!\" and funny thing is I think people had the complete opposite reaction as me because I think they though the trailer looked great and then hated the film while me I hated the trailer and Loved the film. So one Friday night I went to blockbuster and rented this movie and order some Pizza, I went home saw it with my sister and some slices of Pizza and completely loved it. And then went on a trip to San Francisco and told to my cousin how much I loved this movie and regretted I did not see it in 3D cause that was the time I started to love the 3D gimmick. But then he told me this movie sucked and did not believe it but then the reality came that most critic and movie fans hated this movie and I felt like the only person who really enjoyed well this is not the first time it happened (Spider-Man 3 and Tron: Legacy I also saw later that year and still really enjoy it) and that the 3D conversion was terrible. And then I grew up and realized script was not great, but I still have so much fun watching it. Like the customs for the Gods are so flashy and ridicules but it so funny. The acting Ralph Fiennes over acting it, Liam Neeson always sounds like going speeches , Gemma Arterton only there for being hot and Sam Worthing being likable but not the best actor around but I kinda like him actually.

The people of Earth begin shunning the Gods, no longer praying towards them, so Hades comes to Olympus and talks Zeus into chastising the humans. And by chastising, I mean brutally murdering and then giving an ultimatum to those still alive: sacrifice the princess of their region or suffer a tentacle-y death (from the Kraken obviously). So Perseus who had been taken into \"custody\" and a legion of soldiers go off to find the Moirai, or the Fates, and hopefully find a way to kill the Kraken.

Dude, Zeus would want to eat Perseus if anything to prevent his own death, which is something he did A LOT in the mythology, because he was paranoid. Hades, as usual in Hollywood fashion, is portrayed as your usual bad guy. And just so everybody who isn't a myth buff knows, Hades wasn't actually a bad guy. He kinda got screwed over and thrown into the Underworld, but he was actually a good guy; his brothers were asses, but I digress. The worst thing he did was kidnap Persephone and force her into marriage, and while it's no defense for what he did, here's why he did it: he didn't know any better. He lived in his father's stomach for years, only to be sent to the Underworld after the war against the Titans where there was no time for love. He kinda was just stuck there and never really learned a good way to romance, so when he saw this beautiful and nice girl, he practically hopped on a chariot, went into the overworld, picked her up and drove her back down with him. He was lonely and again, not an excuse, but that's the reason. And you can tell he was a good guy because he still let her go to the overworld one day every year (which is when spring begins).

With that it delivers on its monstrous sea titan the Kraken as well as giant scorpions, the winged Pegasus, and the snake haired Gorgon Medusa who can turn her victims to stone at a glance. What makes the original so much better is its passion for character and story. This film misses out on the whole back story regarding Calibos and his curse regarding Andromeda, as well as the bitterness amongst the gods. Director Louis Leterrier subtracts any dramatic impact of the original for cheap tie in scenes such as the sword in the forest or the Pegasus horses that just happen to be around. The original used great dramatic payoff to produce these elements. Leterrier had better luck when he made The Incredible Hulk. Sam Worthington as Perseus, son of Zeus is a joke. Liam Neeson as Zeus is an even bigger joke showing his perverted authority. Ralph Fiennes as Hades is a laugh. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda just hangs in midair. Watching her take pity on Perseus will make us long for the authority and boldness that Judi Bowker possessed when she performed this role correctly. Gemma Arterton also graces us with her presence and it couldn't be any less welcome than it is when combine with this garbage. The special effects are the norm but even CGI is hardly a replacement when the original had stop motion creativity by Ray Harryhausen that is the stuff of great imaginative imagery. This remake should clash with a fireplace. Score: 1 / 10 \n",

Naturally an 'updated version' needs more than a few people in sandals and plastercine monsters and the remake does just that. There is a fair amount of computer-generated special effects, but they're not the problem. One of the main complaints against the new version is that it was filmed in NON-3D and then converted into 3D in post-production, therefore creating a slightly blurred and grainy effect overall.\n",

            "And there are some other problems with the finished product, but many of those are cosmetic. Take the lead actor's (Sam Worthington) hair. It's supposed to be ancient Greece and yet he's the only man without long flowing hair choosing instead for a crewcut. Then of course you have a largely British cast (or at least actors putting on 'British' accents) while Worthington's natural Australian accent does tend to slip through occasionally. And maybe the most petty gripe I can think of is naming the Greek town Worthington's trying to save after a popular British 'catelogue store' it always amused me when they're desperate to save 'Argos.'\n",

She was a tough act to follow after her portrayal in the original and, even though she is now fully CGI, she's actually pretty nasty! For some reason though the director felt the need to add too many lens flares (in my opinion) in all the scenes where the Gods were present in Olympus!\n",

Yes, those of us who were brought up on the original will always prefer that version, but I imagine that there are plenty of kids (young boys I'm guessing) who will love watching Perseus slay one computer generated monster after the next. My main gripe was that I found Perseus' 'love interest' a little wooden. Yes, I see the reason the film-makers shoe-horned in a woman to go on the adventure, but she just kind of delivered her lines like she was reading them from an autocue. I don't know whether this is a fault with the director, not getting the best out of her, as I've seen Gemma Arterton in plenty of other films and she's always turned in a better performance.\n",

It easily deserves a 7 on IMDb. I think some aspects of the movie could be compared to Thor. Thor was definitely much more enjoyable than this. I reckon the main reason this movie is not rated as highly as Thor is that unlike Thor, the characters in this movie are rather one dimensional and you never really get to know or care about them much. The entire movie is like you're watching it from a third person perspective, which is not as engaging as it could have been had the characters been given more screen time and a richer back story.

At least it acknowledges the charm of the original was based around the wonderful stop motion animation, which it predictably replaces with an abundance of digital effects, including several CGI monsters copied directly from its predecessor (though not necessarily present in the original Greek myth), including giant scorpions and a very snake like Medusa. The plot remains largely the same, though in this more modern look on mythology the gods are treated with much less respect, portrayed as interfering omnipotent beings leeching off of humanity's worship over them, which is rapidly diminishing, making Zeus (who else but Liam Neeson) angry enough to release the monstrous Kraken on mankind, though he still deems humanity worthy enough to allow his son Perseus (Sam Worthington displaying his usual poor acting skills) to successfully fight the terror. Meanwhile, Zeus himself is betrayed by his brother Hades (Ralph Fiennes playing yet another effectively scary bad guy), God of Death who by now is undoubtedly used to play the villain in Hollywood's contemporary view on mythology so Perseus also needs to save his daddy despite not carrying much love for him. Though fairly entertaining, this movie simply features too much digital creature fights to make any of them memorable, except maybe for the final Kraken battle. The film is infamous for its horribly poor post-conversion 3-D effects, adding little depth at all but instead messing up many a shot. Though the movie covers most of the original film and actual myth, the amount of money it made warranted a sequel, Wrath of the Titans (2012), which ixnayed the story altogether and focused almost exclusively on people fighting digital monsters, to predictably disappointing results. Despite the failure, a third Clash is in the works.

At first there was one scorpion and minutes later, there were about 5 more and I couldn't figure out where the hell did they come from. I blame this on Louis Leterrier, the director of this film.

Definitely the two of them worked great when they were on screen together and they possibly represent the only good aspect of this film.

            "409 )  Don't get me wrong, I like the whole movie start to finish, but it's so disappointing. It's not like the original 1983 Clash of the Titans was any better. I'm usually fairly easy going when it comes to popcorn flicks that serve no real purpose except to exist as silly fun. Still, there is a little bit of drawbacks in this film. If you follow real Greek mythology, you will be disappointed. If you follow the original movie, then you will be disappointed, too. This film takes this myth to a new direction, while keeping the basis close to mind. The movie by director Louis Leterrier was still interesting. Surprising a movie that has a title \"Clash of the Titans\" and titans are only once briefly mentioned, that if you say a word, you lose it. Who the hell made the decision of placing an monster named Kraken in the Ancient Greece? Isn't that Norse mythology? Then you got Djinns in this? Isn't that Arabic mythology? The biggest change from the original 1983 movie and this was the love story between the hero Perseus (Sam Worthington) and the princess Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). They change it, to love between the hero and the immortal nymph Io (Gemma Arterton). It was rather a better love story than the original in my opinion, but still the princess made more sense since it's in the Greek mythology, and Io wasn't in this story. Anyways, Perseus is a demi-God who must rescue the princess from a sea monster sent by the Gods. By doing this, he has to kill the Gorgon monster known as Medusa who can turn any onlookers into stone and use her head as a weapon. All in all, this movie was just another visual CGI feast. The CGI is breath taking, but the way they conversion the film 2D to 3D made the movie look horrible. There are blurry scenes, and examples of with people's hair flowing beyond their heads without anything holding it. The hero is hardly likable as he doesn't talk much, the two hunters really served no role and kind of left the group before they did anything useful, the Medusa battle killed nearly everyone within minutes, including all the soldiers I actually cared about. The only actual scene I enjoyed was the Medusa fight, the combination of stealth, fighting an enemy you can't see, and arrows was pretty cool. But what on Earth were they trying to make Medusa look beautiful? The original 1983's Medusa was scary. This one makes her look like a super model with snakes on her. With all the hype behind the Kraken, you'd think it would be an epic battle but it only in screen time for a short period of time. Way disappointing. I got confused, I thought it was the Cloverfield monster or a Rancor from Star Wars: Return of the Jedi. I have to say the flute scene was a bit funny. Who knew bitch was a word in ancient time as well. About the acting. It was mediocre. Sam Worthington plays the exact same character he played in every other film he has been in. Gemma Arterton's performance was boring and emotionless as usual and even though Liam Neeson tried his best to fit in with the role as Zeus, his talent was utterly wasted. Ralphs Fiennes does his Voldemort voice for Hades which was kinda annoying. Overall: Effects looked pretty but the story was half assed and character development was non-existent. It's just mindless eye candy. Probably good for a rental or a free watch on television one day. \n",

Second the the flying horsey Pegasos should have been white and not black, you guys should have done more research. Now the third thing and that was the fighting scenes was to short, like against Kraken and Hades just trowing a sword and he goes down to the underworld again... thought he was more powerful than that...could have dodged it or grabbed it.

            "417 )  Based on the 1981 film of the same name, Clash of the Titans is a big budget CGI-fest that aims to dazzle the senses with it's busy action sequences and sprawling scopes. With a heavyweight cast and a dizzying $125m budget, director Louis Letterier has created what is essentially a rushed looking collection of overblown set pieces assembled around chunks of dull exposition. This is the story of demigod Perseus, played by Sam Worthington, and his quest to fight as a man, for man against the vengeful Gods of Olympus who are royally 'cheesed off' because some soldiers took it upon themselves to knock down a big statue of Zeus Liam Neeson no less. So, fresh from the 'underworld', up pops big bad God Hades (Ralph Fiennes), embracing his inner Voldermort, to teach mankind a lesson. Frankly, why Zeus would ever set a God with blatant mental health issues loose on a species he claims to love is never fleshed out, but then again, this isn't a film that invests much time fleshing much of anything out. Instead, it's far more concerned with getting some of that $125m budget and shoving it in your face. And so it does. Along the ahem, 'epic' quest (presented via a series of sweeping CG exteriors), we encounter all manner of CG behemoths, none of which are animated with any convincing real world heft. The Medusa part of the story, the chapter i always found to be the most riveting and frightening as a child, sacrifices any genuine creepiness by being a noisy and action heavy overload of computer generated disappointment, which all but sums up the film. Sam Worthington fails to inject any personality into Perseus, Gemma Arterton looks pale faced and pretty while Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes most likely pick up a decent payday in exchange for a bit of hammy overdoing it. When the inevitable conclusion finally comes, it's a welcome relief. With it's swordplay and excitable action, the film may function satisfactorily for an early teen audience, but for most it's sorely lacking in many areas, most crucially character and script. Despite much derision aimed at it's eleventh hour retro-fitted 3D release, the film turned over an almighty $493.2m in global box office although if you've seen the spoiler heavy trailer first, you've pretty much seen the whole thing. Cash of the Titans might have been a more appropriate title. \n",

This movie just blew my brains out of my head and straight on the floor! I could not, for the life of me, notice a single coherent line in the whole chaotic mess that is, very liberally, called this movies \"storyline\". If i watch this as a cinematic film piece that should make sense and perfect logic, then, no, this is not a very good cinematic film piece, but if i watch it as an epic video game intro, which it is, then - whoa!! The main character gets shield upgrades, new weapons, skills, a gang of skilled fighters. He voyages and encounters big bosses for which he must use different tactics. CotT is in fact a clever RPG movie filed with INSANE amounts of epic. Epic hot chicks, epic soldier stone smile, epic jinn or whatever the hell he is, epic black F***ING Pegasus, none of that white sissy stuff flies here, epic Kraken that we see only for less than a minute in the movie, epic lines like \"Don't look this bitch in the eye.\", epic black Pegasus running on the beach in slow-mo.

The original Clash of the Titans told pretty much the exact same story much better, and Harryhausen's effects have more character than the CGI seen here which feels just as fake but now happens in a computerised mess where it's hard to clearly see the monsters. The only saving graces are the often good cinematography and a host of good actors who turn in some decent work that's still well below their normal standards. Overall the whole film feels completely forgettable; a retelling of a better story which was already a mix of several Greek myths. \n",

I mean, so many things about this old movie was good, I watched it as a kid, and I was blown away, especially by Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, his Medusa... scary... his Kraken... amazing... the music score was astonishing.

I expected something like... two and a half hours, but we just got a fast film that is filled with special effects, that's just it. No emotions, here's bunch of computer effects and they were good... but sucked. The CGI was sooo... artificial, and when I remember the stop-motion from old version... that was freaking real! It was there, simply it was there. But these... damn! Now, a star Sam Worthington, well he was not all that bad, but he constantly speaks in some low tones and, honestly he can do more than that, come on man, you're not Steven Seagal, free that voice of yours! Liam Neeson as Zeus? Well, pretty cool, if you ask me. But still, again in some father like role... Ralph Fiennes as Hades? Good, he was OK. But, when I heard that James Woods showed interest to play Hades in live action film... I thought... that would be a joke. Alexa Davalos as Andromeda... good, she was OK, haven't seen her in long time. Gemma Arterton as Io? Who's she? She was not needed. Waste of time character. Jason Flemyng as Calibos? He is a good actor, but I expected someone bigger and more menacing. This Calibos is nothing but a berserk monster, the original one was more scary and commanding...

All quite superb. But, the script is so bad that none of that can be overlooked while trying to enjoy the picture. The original 1981 film didn't have a fabulous script either, but it was head and shoulders above this. And the effects in that film, even by Ray Harryhousen's standards, were a bit rough. But it made for a much more enjoyable evening. I don't think the actors can be judged, because the lines they were given no one could deliver. It does all come down to the script. Or some over zealous producer demanding scenes and plots get added. If anyone has ever seen Kevin Smith's story about working on a script for Superman and the producer kept saying, \"yeah, cool.

            "424 )  Did you hear that? That was me sighing, the trailer certainly gave the impression this was going to be something special and that they had nailed the fantasy action target. Unfortunately they haven't.. It's a film that isn't as good as the sum of its parts, no wait a minute, that's wrong, even the parts aren't that good. A series of loose encounters that seem under played and under worked leaving you with a feeling that it's all style and no substance. From the moment the rating was unveiled it was clear that they were going to pull all their punches to allow as wider audience as possible to see this mess. A tighter, leaner more adult approach would have benefited this film no end, instead we get superfluous, ridiculous looking characters that come and go without any real purpose. Where is the suspense? Where is the tension? Where are the darker elements the story aspires to? You don't get any of these elements. As an example, they have to kill the infamous mythological creature Medusa and there is no sense of fear or tension. And that counts for practically all the enemies in the film accept, perhaps, the giant scorpions. Anyway, enough is enough, a disappointment, a missed opportunity and not a very good film. If you've got a taste for mythology try the original 1981 film instead. \n",
            "\n",
            "425 ) Okay so this is a movie about Greek mythology and a very shallow and narrow one at that. To put it simply this movie pretty much sucks, there is almost nothing special about this movie and almost nothing stands out. The plot is very narrow and simple, sort of like going from point A to point B but there is nothing really imaginative or creative or even entertaining about it. The actor Sam Worthington came out of nowhere and was in \"Terminator Salvation\", \"Avatar\" and now this. And I guess Hollywood is trying to sell him off as the next big thing but he just plays a boring and generic character in everything I saw in him so far, which is few but still. If this was a video game cut-scene it might be somewhat forgivable but it's not. In fact watching the video game \"God of War\" is more entertaining than this. The CGI is alright but nothing all that special and same elements has been done before and can get kinda crappy sometimes for a movie that was released in 2010. The movie is about a half human half god guy named Perseus(Same Worthington) rising up against the gods. Liam Neeson looks the part and fits Zeus very well but his character is easily manipulated. The gods in this movie just seem pretty weak mentally and there powers seem far from being omnipotent. But some parts in the Greek mythology is like this but it gets sort of awkward in a negative way because the gods in this seem too human sometimes. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades who is sort of the opposite of Zeus in some ways. Which is interesting because the last time these two actors played opposites in the same movie was in \"Schindler's List\". One aspect I liked about this movie though personally is how it shows how arrogance can lead to downfall including when it comes to the mortals. I also find it interesting how Luke Evans who plays Apollo in this will play Zeus in \"Immortals\". For marketing reason this film goes 3D as well at last minute and the outcome isn't very good. I haven't seen the original but I have a feeling that it must be better than this. The man build up is for the Kraken and even that was disappointing, it's very short and it's nowhere close to a epic fight. Hollywood does a good job of making the trailers way more epic than the movie itself and that applies this.\n",

One new character whose performance I really enjoyed was Hades, God of the Underworld. He's so creepy, complex, and awesome that while humanity mocks the gods, he puts them in their place. Nice! Sam Worthington's portrayal of Persius is nicely done as he does as much as he can without much help to prove that he's more man than god, though this somewhat stubborn outlook does backfire on him a little, making things a little more interesting.

Medusa is absolutely great as while she has the same basic look as before, her improved design combines both her once great beauty with her serpentine lethality. This makes her both sexy and deadly. The Kraken is by far the most awesome as not only does he look cool, but he is also a terrifying and destructive force of nature, which is enough for the gods to we themselves with fear.

In the original film, his love interest is Andromeda (as is the case in the myth) where as the filmmakers added Io into the mix, who becomes Perseus' love interest. The problem with Io is that she is not apart of this myth. In fact the story of Io is set much earlier than many of the other myths. Io was one of Zeus' lovers, however she was turned into a Heifer to hide her from Hera. However, Hera was not fooled, and set a gadfly to eternally torment her, driving her from place to place. Io was not human either, she was a Neried, a demi-god connected with nature and spring, and it is also suggested that her father was a river god.

The only reason I would ever care if some Greek dude got obliterated would be if he had a cool hairdo.

The remake is a more serious and action packed romp. The story has been added to, but they should have cut some stuff. Calibos shows up a couple of times but is pretty pointless as Hades is the main villain. The film excels thanks to the reliable Mads Mikkelson, whom gives his character some depth and delivers his lines with absolute conviction. It's a film that should satisfy the action junkies. Each set-up is played out on massive sets and on location. Leterrier's greenscreen reduction allows the world to seem very real. Ironically, the film is just as patchy as the original in terms of effects. The Medusa scene almost ruined the entire film. It was too fast, forgetting to build tension, and eliminating characters to simplify the ending. As for the CGI in the Medusa scene, it was as textureless and terrible as the Scorpion King in The Mummy Returns. It's amazing that 29 years on, a film with advanced technology could fail to capture the terrifying simplicity of stop- motion. The Kracken did look fantastic, and the scorpions were so-so.

Quite coincidentally, Argos is still standing too, as the Kraken unleashed by the underworld god Hades failed to destroy the city. I'm not sure how the legend of Medusa's gaze turning humans to stone translates to evil sea monsters, but I'll go with it.

I do recall some of the cheesy effects from two decades ago, but that had to do with the available technology. The CGI involved here is pretty skillful, the one that caught my interest the most was the aforesaid Medusa with that slither thing going on. The Kraken sequence was pretty amazing too, but gee, wasn't the monster defeated just a little too easily? Perseus (Sam Worthington) didn't have to do much more than stretch his arm out to make the save for Andromeda (Alexa Davalos). Takes some of the fun out of being the hero.\n",

Thought, the plot could have been more and better developed, but it is OK for a 106 minutes movie. Other critics remain mostly on the uncompleted story of Perseus. The movie contains just some scenes from the written myth and his journey to the Medusa. The actors provided an impressive acting, especially Ralph Fiennes who played Hades. The movie starts very promising with strong and symbolic action scenes and stays interesting and action packed until the end. I recommend to watch it on a big screen and digital surround. \n",

This was nothing short of a hatchet job meant to spew some pretentious, pseudo-political garbage about man replacing gods. They eliminated most everything that was good about the original movie and downplayed the rest. What is left over is rushed and, in many respects, poorly produced. The characters were dull, the action tame and the plot was annoying. Frankly I have seen cartoons that I liked better than this. I'm hoping that this movie will be another Incredible Hulk.

Therefore the 3D effects look like crap because not only was it rushed, but it wasn't filmed in 3D!!! So if it was that bad why the hell would you sit through the entire movie then write a review on how bad the movie was? Go get your money back and watch it in 2D! As for the movie itself; I had only seen the original about a week before seeing the remake. While I enjoyed some elements of the original, I thought it was lacking in terms of pace. This film, definitely improves on the pace, and you get to care a bit more the rest of the soldiers that followed Perseus into the underworld. My main complaint is that they added a new female character to the plot, and as much as I enjoy seeing Gemma Aterton, it pushed away focus from Andromeda. Who really was crucial to the plot. So here we are caring for Io, and not really seeing enough of Andromeda to really be concerned for her. Yet the whole plot is about saving her more or less.\n",

The remake on the other hand has fantastic CGI, the battles were nicely done, acting was OK, story was straight forward, in short it was an entertaining movie, for it delivered what it promised. The only thing I didn't like was the main hero who seemed out of place -he looked and acted like a jock or a street gang member in the 21st century. The actor in the original did a much better job.

I also liked a lot Eddie Redmaine in this film, i've never seen him before anywhere, but he definitely convinced me in this role of Marius. And i became absolutely speechless about Anne Hathaway; she was just phenomenal in the film, one of the best performances by a woman in a musical since Bj?rk in Dancer in the Dark, though Hathaway definitely did a better job. To be honest, it's one of the greatest performances ever. No jokes. I really doubt Hathaway would ever repeat half of the effort she put on Les Miserables. Of course, Amanda Seyfried was very annoying, one of the most cringing voices in the film, if not the most. But she acted well. All the cast did, including the Tarnadiers infamous hustle couple, being Madame Thernadier interpreted by Helena Bonham Carter and the always hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen interpreting the dirty monsieur Thernadier. Both were always hilarious when they appeared in the film, despite them being despicable and hated persons in the Victor Hugo's book.

I've read the novel when I was a teen and finding out it's been made into a musical really took me by surprise. This isn't a story that should be translated into a musical, and this is coming from a huge fan of musicals. Granted, I haven't seen the Broadway version, but a fact is a fact: the story is far too complex and goes deep into character development, musicals simply can't portray that much depth. Most musicals are well aware of this, mind you, so their stories are usually straight to the point to allow the viewer to focus on both the story and the music.\n",

Maybe it's a lack of exposure to musicals, maybe it's the need to like whatever's mainstream and blending in with the hive.

            "464 )  Okay... the first time i saw \"Les Miserables\" i didn't like it so much... well, i'm going to be honest i hate it. I was eight years old i think, and my father told me that i have to see it, and that was all. But then i saw it again, the last year and i thought it was really good. The characterization was excellent and all the set and the special effects was fascinating. The film is partitioned by three parts, so i'm going to go part by part. Te first part is about Jean ValJean, who is a prisoner in the old France, and the policeman, whose name is Javert. Javert give the conditional to ValJean, who's going to be constrained by those papers all his life. He know that he can't be free at all with those papers so he decided to broke them and start a new life. Personally i find this part a little bit boring, but i think is necessary to understand the rest of the history so it's okay. In the second part ValJean starts his life as mayor of the town. He is totally different but soon Javert discover that he's the prisoner ho broke his parole, so he starts to seek ValJean to see him again at prison. At the same time ValJean starts to meet more characters of the film, like Fantine, or her daughter Cosette. This part is more interesting than the last, cause you know more characters and the history start to have sense. And in the third part, you know the rest of the characters like Enjorlas, the lead of the revolutionaries; Marius, who's in love with Cosette; Eponine, who's smitten of Marius, or Gavroche, who is a boy who goes to the barricades with the revolutionaries being like an adult boy. In this part you are totally enmeshed in the film and yo feel like you are in the barricades with all this people fighting for the freedom. In conclusion I think this film is full of emotions and all the type of feelings: sadness, happiness, euphoria... and i thin that all the people who like to laugh, or the love, the tragedy or the belligerent conflicts have to see this film. It was simply perfect. \n",

            "465 )  Superb movie. I saw the Broadway show. Loved it. Loved the music. I have the CD's. I know it pretty much by heart now. I also have other film versions of Hugo's masterpiece, but they are not musicals. This film version tops them all. It even helped me understand a few things not obvious in other versions. Anne Hathaway as Fantine is so, so good - her interpretation of 'I Dreamed a Dream' became a classic the second I saw it. Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean is excellent and very believable. Eddie Redmayne is a very good Marius and seems so sincere - his role became more important to me than in previous versions of plays or films. Russell Crowe as Javert is not that good though. That is not his element it seems; he is not bad, just a bit too ordinary. The Thenardiers are funny, a bit over the edge though, but it helps keeping the movie from being too 'serious'. Surprising role for Helena Bonham Carter, but she is very good. Is was a very nice gesture to have Colm Wilkinson as Bishop of Digne since he played Jean Valjean so often on Broadway and West End versions of the play. True to the original story. Better than the Broadway show even, I must say. Must see, large screen if you can. \n",

            "466 )  Considering the 2017 Academy Awards are coming up very soon, February 26th to be exact, I thought it was the perfect time to recap exactly why Les Miserables won three of the eight Academy Awards it was nominated for in 2013. Winning Best Supporting Actress, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Makeup all hold true when considering this films major strengths. Looking at the amount of singing, how the actors fit their roles, and the overall flow throughout the film are what make this production great. There is no doubt in saying that this film is musically-driven. I was a bit taken aback with the first scene when Russell Crowe, playing Javert, started lecturing Hugh Jackman, taking the role of a slave named Jean Valjean. To my surprise, every word was sung, right from the start! Even though I knew this film was based on a musical, I did not expect the singing to begin so early on, let alone be the very first words said by the actors. The idea that every word is going to be sung is startling at first, yet catchy and becomes expected after a while. In a way I enjoyed that the characters only sang their verses, because when a scene involving a violent reaction where you would expect a lot of yelling came up, their soft tones gave way to calm voices. This is where the excellent use of background music would pick up and add to the suspense or tension of the situation, hence the award for Best Sound Mixing. Once you do get used to the fact that the majority of what you will hear are the exceptionally graceful voices of the actors, the film flows quite nicely, showing exactly why Les Miserables is a great musical production. Speaking of the actors, they made this film ten times more enjoyable to watch due to their impressive performances. Anne Hathaway went beyond what I was expecting for the short, yet extremely important, time she was in the spotlight. Her emotions and body language shown were alarmingly believable. Especially in the most degrading scene where her humanity was violently stripped from her, Anne Hathaway's image was so convincing without her having to say a word. Another lead actor, Hugh Jackman, brought an act that was so natural and modest I was simply satisfied when he was performing. His ability to relate to the other actors on an emotional level, especially when deciding to take in Fantine's child after she passed, was very believable and sincere. The way that all the characters connect and come together in the end really solidifies any wandering thoughts or questions that may arise during the film. The way these actors present themselves in their individual roles and also together as a cast, makes this film flow so easily. Along with the connectedness of the characters, the way the producer continuously brings items and actors back into later scenes shows the importance of certain aspects throughout the film. For instance, the two silver candles that give Hugh Jackman his character early on in the film reappear multiple times, like a sort of motif. Along with this subtle addition in the film, the way each song moves into and out of the next so fluently adds to the overall neat and easy to follow story line. Over the course of many years, the actors also reappear with just enough of a changed appearance that it is hard to notice until they sing. Les Miserables achieves a great sense of flow by incorporating these qualities that give the film its greatness. Overall, Les Miserables is remarkably deserving of the Academy Awards it received in 2013. The film proved to be outstanding due to the musical talent, exceptional actors who played their roles perfectly, and the way the film created a sense of flow. \n",

I think for the most part this film was very impressive, it's not without its flaws but found this film to be very much worth the watch. When Tom Hooper won the Oscar for The Kings Speech the only thing that really bothered me about that was the fact that it didn't really put his talents on full display but their front and centre here, all the musical numbers and character direction is perfect, it really did make you believe the dire situation that these characters lived in and it truly proved to me his talent as a director. Hugh Jackman was absolutely brilliant in this film, not only is his singing voice fantastic but he carried a real burden and shame with him that Jackman perfectly portrayed. Few performances limited performances have impressed as much as Anne Hathaway in this film, her absolute emotional destruction was perfectly conveyed through her performance and created for some truly emotionally tragic scenes. When I hear bad things about Russell Crowes performance all I can do is scratch my head, I thought he was amazing in this film, he was a true antagonist who was not all the different from Valjean and I though Crowe brought true complexity to the character. This film also looks stunning, all the French streets, dirty alleys and poverty ridden areas truly gave out an impression that truly hooked me. But I don't think this film base some issues for one, after the first 20 minutes the film failed to really grip or interest me, it slowed the film down completely and seemed to spend to much time devoted to setting up the final act rather than give a compelling narrative of its own. The run time is also a bit excessive and the pacing drags quite a lot for me. Also seeing as it is a film called, The Miserable it's got a lot of really sad scenes that while obviously need to be there just don't make me want to go back and watch it again.\n",

            "Les Miserables stars Hugh Jackman, supported by Oscar winners Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne. Set in France, this musical drama begins in 1815 and spans nearly twenty years over the course of its two and a half hour run time. Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) is released from prison, but is put on parole for the remainder of his life. Because of his criminal record, he struggles to obtain a job, shelter, or good reputation, and decides to make a new start, destroying his parole papers and going into hiding. Eight years later, Valjean has become mayor of a small town and a factory owner, but is shocked to cross paths with his old parole officer, Inspector Javert (Russell Crowe). Seeking to live a godly life, Valjean provides care for his former employee (Anne Hathaway) and her daughter (Amanda Seyfried), all while running from his past.\n",
            "\n",
            "Les Miserables is a true form musical; nearly the entire film is sung. While this makes for a unique film experience, muffled lines and the complete lack of spoken dialogue can oftentimes cause confusion regarding plot details. The music takes advantage of the leitmotif technique, giving each character a short \"theme\" that they sing recurringly. Each theme is linked with its character and creates an identifiable musical identity.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film focuses on character, using their lyrics and leitmotifs to show viewers the thoughts and feelings of each character. The characters were well rounded and developed nicely. Although singing to express emotions is a straightforward way to develop characters, it is incredibly effective at allowing these characters to become relatable. For instance, when a character sings \"I love him,\" audiences immediately know the mood and feelings of that character, and can focus on how that character's actions, expressions, and words relate to that phrase. Jean Valjean, the protagonist, is somewhat of a tragic hero. Although he does not experience a transition from good to evil, he experiences relatable emotions (fear, sadness, love) and tragedies (imprisonment, loss of loved ones, running from the law).\n",
            "\n",
            "The music is the centerpiece in the film, but it never quite hits the mark. The beautiful accompaniment is often hidden beneath sound effects and vocals, and the singing itself was often breathy and out of tune (although to the actors' credit, the music was sung live during filming, not recorded in a sound studio). The sets and costumes were the true showstoppers, elaborate, well- made, and giving the film a realism that it could have never achieved as a stage musical. ? ?The cinematography contained a few unique angles and shot selections that contributed to the musical nature of the film. Oftentimes, the singers stared either directly or indirectly into the camera, as if they were singing to the audience (not unusual on a stage, but an odd choice for a film adaptation). There were also many wide shots and aerial views of Paris, which would normally be an impossibility in a stage performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a whole, the film's acting, score, and set design were exquisite, but the poor singing scattered throughout proved to be a major distraction.? The film (PG-13) requires a mature audience; it contains some suggestive material, but also explores deep themes beyond the grasp of most young viewers. Despite the scope and effort behind the film, Les Miserables can't quite reach the high note it strains to achieve. \n",

As a reader of the original Victor Hugo's novel I found that the movie is a true reproduction of the original one, very touching, impressive . Anne Hathaway as Fantine brought tears in my eyes, extremely afraid after spitting on Jean Valjean , incredible performance and incredible talent. Jean Valjean the innocent prisoner , the one who feel the injustice as he was jailed just because he stole a piece of bread to feed his hunger, also an incredible performance from Hugh Jackman. Finally the unique performance of Russell Crowe, the aggressive stone-hearted Javert, who think he is serving God and justice, with his rigid cruelty look.

And yet, it came to me that I was writing about a character I knew nothing about other than what little was spoonfed to us from our English textbook - who exactly was Jean Valjean? Police Inspector Javert? Fantine? What message did the author want to convey upon writing about a common man in 17th century Paris?\n",

It succeeds in making you grit your teeth because life is so, so unfair, and there are many who suffer because of it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Those who have read the novel have stated that this is the more emotional version, by far, when compared to the 1998 version, because it truly gets the characters' intentions across (and apparently, the 1998 version strays from the characters of the source material). If these are the characters in their true forms - then I can ask for nothing more, because these characters took my breath away. Jean Valjean's conflict with the past that continuously haunts him and the man that he has become, Cosette's curiosity and love for her father (and vice versa), Marius' devotion to his cause and what he felt for all that he lost because of it, Fantine's living hell, Eponine's unrequited love and selflessness, and Inspector Javert's conflict regarding justice and mercy.\n",

What was this irony, wherein only death would put an end to Jean Valjean's suffering, offering him mercy in times when many else started walking into the light, all the fruit of his efforts to love and to repent and to begin anew? It was clear that he was no longer the man that he used to be, yet he was driven to an end that he did not deserve because people branded him for what he HAD done (and even then, it was to feed his sister's seven children!). I found myself asking what Javert must have asked himself, looking down at the world he would soon part with. (\"Look down, look down,\" the voices sung.) Was justice a truth, or an ideal pursued blindly? Could all things be encompassed by the law? Questioning all he believed, he too, ended his life.\n",

Eponine, dying in the arms of the only man she ever loved, asking nothing more than to be glanced at by him. To be his heaven, and his only one. Gavroche, walking towards the soldiers, believing in what they fought for, then reaching his untimely end. Enjolras, a brave soul that died for his countrymen and a good friend to all he knew. Marius, waking up to the aftermath, finding that all his friends he had laughed with were gone. Cosette telling him that they would never be apart, and that he still had her. Marius, telling Cosette that they would never be apart during Jean Valjean's dying moments - Jean Valjean's last moments which were spent thinking about Cosette, and only Cosette (thus, Fantine's appearance near the end).\n",

Certain things could have been cut out of the movie to fix this problem, such as removing the comedic relief scenes, or by removing/shorting some of the less needed music numbers.

So many things happened in a single musical theater but everything was portrayed very well. From Jean Valjean held captive until he became the father of Cosette is truly heartwarming. Anne Hathaway shone with her beautiful voice as well as Hugh Jackman which is a real shocking, well, for me.

In this movie, all dialog is in songs, so it's a little bit different than usual musical movies. One thing I want to say is the way to shoot this movie is very fantastic! When people shoot musical movies, before the shooting starts actors record songs and they move their mouth without singing when they shoot. But this movie takes different way. Actors put ear monitor on and sing with listening only piano. Actors sing the way they want to sing, so they can act and sing very naturally. So actors in this movies have great and wonderful skills.

The casts : Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, Russel Crowe as Javert, Anne Hathway as Fantine, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Eddie Redmayne as Marius, Samantha Barks as Eponine and many more.

Then he found the man \"24601\" but because Jean was a good man he admitted that. Then he met Fantine, she works at Jean's place but she was fired because the stupid major. After that Fantine must find job to support her child, Cosette who live at .. (like hotel), then she work as slut and she sick.

            "\n",
            "The acting is absolutely fantastic. With Hugh Jackman, Russel Crowe, Anne Hathaway, and Eddie Redmayne in the same movie, that can be expected.

            "On a side note: as others eluded the actual musical (the original) is superior in almost every aspect. But if you're into \"mediocre singing\" this movie might be just what you're looking for (it sure made me cringe a couple of times when Russel Crowe opened his mouth).\n",

After breaking parole, he will settle down with another name, but the goodness that he feels will compel him to take a child to look after, the daughter of a woman who couldn't help. Directed by Tom Hooper, the film has a screenplay written by William Nicholson and other helpers, based on the homonymous story of Victor Hugo. The cast is headed by Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and Sacha Baron Cohen, among other actors.\n",
            "\n",
            "The story of this film needs no introduction. This is one of the most famous novels of Victor Hugo, already adapted to the cinema, theater and also musical theater. In fact, most of the songs the film features are, in fact, taken from the stage musical. So, more than a film adaptation of a book, this is a film adaptation of a musical play.\n",
            "\n",
            "No criticisms to make about the script: he convincingly adapts the story, preserving the magic of music. The actors are huge monsters of talent with excellent voices. Jackman gave a pure soul to his character, contrasting with the vocal gravity of Russell Crowe, who gave body to Javert, a man obsessed with the punishment of criminals and disbelieving in their rehabilitation. They're strong characters, played by seasoned actors with a huge presence on scene. The action scenes between them are breathtaking. Anne Hathaway also deserves a special mention, not only by the physical effort she felt to become Fantine (she became extremely thin and almost bald for the role), but mainly by the quality of what she could do. Staying with one of the most dramatic characters in the film, she played some of the most tragic scenes, and singed their saddest song, \"I Dreamed A Dream\". Its impossible not to cry watching these scenes and listening to the wonderful way the actress managed to sing that song and give a soul, almost martyr, to her character.\n",
            "\n",
            "The scenarios are excellent and try to be faithful to the book and the story. The costumes too, and some of them deserve applause, portraying fairly the misery when the poorest lived. The visual effects fulfill their role discreetly but efficiently, and the soundtrack probably will be remembered by all who are watching this movie. Winner of three Oscars (Best Supporting Actress, Best Characterization, Best Editing and Sound Mixing), this is a film for the family and for everyone. \n",
            "\n",
            "485 )  The well known story of Les miserables as a musical, this time, for me, it failed to deliver. The amazing cast and the beautiful shots and sequences of the revolution and the struggles that people had to endure, are overshadowed by the failure the keep the interest high throughout the movie. The songs focus mainly on the drama, but they do get boring, especially for someone who doesn't love musicals, but just wanted to see what all the buzz was about. The performances were splendid, although, for me, having the con couple act as the comical part of the film felt out of place and sometimes ridiculous. So 3 out of 10. \n",
            "\n",
            "486 ) Before seeing this movie, I'd heard of Les Miserables, but never knew what it was about. Wow! Very interesting story. It's sad, but with a title like Les Miserables, I don't know how one can expect anything else.\n",

            "Now, I have to share my opinion regarding the choices for the production of this movie. I could rant on and on about how a city full of French people sound like their English because an English accent is apparently the default accent for anyone who isn't American. Sure, that's annoying, but I had bigger concerns.\n",
            "\n",
            "I felt that this movie had some serious casting issues. Les Miserables is supposed to be an opera. The people who were cast in this movie are NOT opera singers and didn't show in any way that they were capable of singing in an opera. That isn't to say that the actors and actresses can't sing. I know some of them can, like Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman. But they don't have the voices needed to pull this type of singing off.\n",
            "\n",
            "After watching this, I decided that I had to see a live production. A few months later, I got my chance. I was blown away by the talent on the stage. But this talent just further emphasized the shortcomings of the actors in the movie. They would have been fine if they were just acting in a regular movie, but they weren't. At times, it was if they were acting while they were singing, such as in \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" It isn't exactly pleasing to the ears when I had to hear Hathaway cry while she sang. I couldn't even understand all of the words at first. Points to her for good acting, though.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only members of the main cast who sounded as if they had the chops to do this the way it's supposed to be done were Samantha Barks and Aaron Tveit. I know Barks played Eponine in the 2010 version of Les Miz. She was phenomenal then and phenomenal in this. The guard at the barricades who spoke to the rebels after Gavroche died also sounded as if he was supposed to be in this movie. Excluding Colm Wilkinson as the bishop (he was the original Valjean on Broadway), the other cast members seemed as if they should have been replaced with lesser- known actors who actually have the range to do this kind of singing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyways, I had to get that off my chest. I only gave this movie a 6 because I liked the story, and I've read about how hard the actors worked on it. I'll always appreciate that it opened my eyes to the world of Les Miz, but I've preferred basically every other version of Les Miz's songs over the ones in the movie. \n",
            "\n",
            "487 ) Although we are not in the times where musicals are as popular, Les Miserables is for me and hopefully for others too a musical which deserves to be watched over and over again. Heart gripping story of people's faith,love and desire for freedom. Great mixture of actors some more some less known giving a good balance. You also have a singing Russel Crowe and he isn't bad at all. Although the story line is quite sad, Sasha Baron Cohen brings in his sense of humor making the musical have everything it needs. Everyone will find something for themselves.\n",

            "AMAZING!!! \n",
            "\n",
            "488 ) I have been a big fan of Les Miserables since I was very young. I remember watching the 10th Anniversary concert on PBS as a kid and just being blown away by the singing, the music, and the story. I became so transfixed by it that I had my mom buy me the unabridged version of Les Miserables by Victor Hugo and read the whole thing .... twice.\n",
            "\n",
            "With all that being said, I was really excited to see this movie. The previews made it look great. I had seen the last version of Les Miserables with Liam Neeson and had been thoroughly disappointed afterwards, especially with the ending. I was really hoping that this one would take the ending further, like the concert does. On that aspect - I was not disappointed at all. The production, the visuals, the costumes, it was all very good. I loved the ending, and I loved the cameo by Colm Wilkenson at the beginning (who played Valjean in the musical). What I did not like was the singing. Yes, they inserted some great big actors to get interest ... but they can't sing worth anything. They can sing better than I can, but when you watch the concert and then you watch this, the songs feel somewhat ... emptier. I was highly disappointed that the casting decision had been aimed more at big names than actual musical talent. Songs that are supposed to be overwhelmingly powerful have been reduced so much that almost none of the emotion you want to feel can possibly be expressed, due to the lack of both the vocal range and the vocal power of the actors.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was a good try .... I suppose for those that never watched the concert it would be very enjoyable. For us life-long fans ... not so much. I am going to stick with the 10th anniversary concert. \n",
            "\n",
            "489 )  Les Miserables. Such an incredible story overall. The book is long and complex and all of that but this certain adaptation was just okay. The main reason being that I don't think that this ensemble cast could tell the story the way they did without singing. The Musical aspect made the film. Without the singing i think the film would be horrid. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway were phenomenal as well as the young girl Amanda Seyfried, boy can she sing. Also I didn't like the young man they chose for Marius, Eddie Redmayne, could have easily found a better choice. Although lots of the movie was hard to focus on, such as the Directing. I don't know Tom Hooper very well but i do respect him for this movie and The King's Speech. I did especially love the cinematography, it fit perfectly with the story. When i read the story this year in school i was able to subtly imagine the words in my head. I feel as though this movie is how most if not everyone sees the words when read. The adapted screenplay seemed easy to adapt into a film, since it was a play even before the film. And though I have read the book, this ending still nearly made me cry. Of course they took some parts out of the book but the minimal amount of. It was a good okay film but i expected more. I understand that it is a sad story of sorrow and new love. But in the end i feel like the main grasped conflict was sadness. I would've loved to see more internal conflict shown through production and acting. I consider this movie at par. \n",
            "\n",
            "490 ) Let me start by saying, I have not seen the Broadway musical for Les Miserables nor have I read the book. My only reference to the songs were from the 25th Anniversary Concert videos on YouTube. The only adaptation I have seen was 1998's Les Miserables with Liam Neeson. Tom Hooper's version of LES MISERABLES is my favorite adaptation of the Victor Hugo novel.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tom Hooper chose to have the actors sing live while filming other than prerecording the songs for playback (as they usually do in musicals). This was a great choice, leaving the actors freedom to act (or in this case sing) with emotion as they see fit. Anne Hathaway's portrayal of Fantine is phenomenal! The preparations she took, like losing some weight when her character was starving and actually cutting off all her hair when she could have worn a wig. Her performance of \"I Dreamed a Dream\" is heartbreaking. Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Jean Valjean is equally phenomenal. He looked completely unrecognizable in the beginning of the film with his dramatic weight loss. I was surprised by the fact that he can really sing! Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen performances are amazing and the roles really suit them. Eddie Redmayne's portray of Marius is great, he really gave emotion to \"Empty Chairs At Empty Tables.\" Samantha Barks is perfectly cast as Eponine, her performance of \"On My Own\" is flawless.\n",
            "\n",
            "I could go on and on about the great performances of the cast, but here are some things that lacked. I felt that Russell Crowe as Javert didn't perform to the level the other actors did. Though his performance with Hugh Jackman in \"The Confrontation\" was great, his performance of \"Stars\" was a bit weak. Amanda Seyfried's portrayal of Cosette was also a bit weak compared to the others. It felt like her singing was drowned out by the other actors in songs like \"Heart Full of Love\" and \"One Day More.\" Both Russell Crowe and Amanda Seyfried did great in the film, but their singing could have been improved. Also, Eponine and Marius' \"A Little Fall of Rain\" is cut too short, it would have been nice had it been a bit longer. The ending scene where Jean Valjean is dying and is greeted by Fantine's spirit is beautifully done.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, LES MISERABLES is an amazing film full of great songs and powerful performances. This is a great film for people who have not seen the Broadway musical or even if you have. Tom Hooper's LES MISERABLES is exactly how I envision the Broadway musical would be. I must warn you, most of the film is singing with very little speaking words, this may not be for everybody. But it is loaded with amazing songs, you may not care. I recommend seeing this film and have tissues at the ready! \n",

            "491 ) Okay so to start out: I absolutely LOVE Anne Hathaway (my favorite princess), Hugh Jackman (He's hot AND has claws), Russell Crowe (I can't stop re-watching and crying to A Beautiful Mind), Amanda Sayfried (My favorite in Mean Girls and she's a really good singer), Eddie Redmayne (His voice, his accent, his looks... I actually watch movies simply because HE is in them *drool*) and Samantha Barks (She IS the best Eponine, ever).\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "The Singing! No, no, no, no. Amanda Seyfried who I KNOW can sing sounds like a chirping bird, and it's unbearable. I know they decided to not record the songs in a studio and act according to them, but to sing while acting and that's a pretty nice idea. Kind of like how they do in musicals. The problem is just that these people aren't trained musical artists. They are are wonderful actors and actresses, BUT listening to them \"sing\" while acting was horrible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Samantha Barks! She is the BEST Eponine according to me. She's an amazing singer and she's done a marvelous job in all the Les Mis productions EXCEPT for this. I don't know what happened, but the key in \"On my own\" was low and the movie's version of On my Own is the worst I've heard by far. I KNOW she's capable to do soooo much more and the only reason for why things went the way it did was because of the directors as far as I can figure out.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "All in all: 1. For future references: Cast musical actors and actresses to do the singing AND the acting is necessary. 2. Before making a new version of a musical, it's best to listen to the actual original songs and know how they are supposed to be performed (For example: On my Own is a cry in the void made by Eponine. She sings in hope to over voice her broken heart. This is a POWERFUL song. Something the directors, writers and musical department failed to realize . 3. I gave this film a 4 because of the acting, ALONE. Watching this movie on mute with subtitles is a very beautiful experience. And that's the only way this'll be an enjoyable movie for me. Looking at Eddie Redmayne and Hugh Jackman... *drool*\n",

But not the story touch me the most , I love this because the thinking about dark and light , lie and true , how people treat the others, . In this movie , I don't see anyone is a villain , even Javert , all I see is in war , the only one hurt is the innocent person : the people , student and the soldier .

I have read the novel that this is based on, and wasn't sure what to expect... would they \"hollywood-ize\" the story just to make it all fit, or to make it work. Of course, it would be VERY difficult to put everything Hugo put into his book into a single film... there were so many explanations, pondering, memories, descriptions, social criticism. However, the things they left out... they picked well. Was it really important to learn about Fantine's past, the love she lost in Paris? They left out the scene of her leaving her child with the innkeepers, but that was OK as well. They changed the plot, having Valjean and the policeman meet during Valjean's imprisonment, while in the book, they didn't meet until Valjean becomes a mayor.\n",

            "All this doesn't even matter. What matters is - this movie is beautiful. The performances are. Yes, it WILL take time to get used to pretty much everything being sung. It might be tough to adjust to that. I don't even wanna THINK about this being on normal TV, with commercial breaks or anything. This is an amazing performance all the way through. The way it was made, with the actors singing on SET while performing, instead of having to lip sync... very bold, and it works.\n",
            "\n",
            "I was very touched by many of the performances. I definitely am no fan of Anne Hathaway or Sasha Baron Cohen. Still, I loved what they did. Anne seemed to really FEEL the pain Fantine felt, the desperation, hopelessness, the feeling of being so wronged, her longing for her daughter. Both actors won me over with this. I will never enjoy the movies they are famous for, such as Princess Bride etc, but here, I simply have to admit they did an amazing job, and I was truly impressed.\n",

Of course, Victor Hugo, author of the book, Les Miserables, played an important role in beauty of the movie because the book is one of the best. While I was watching the movie, I remembered the book that I read almost 15 years ago. I perceived the same feelings after 15 years and that made me really happy.

Any high school kid (with or without a music background) could come up with stuff like this. Anne Hathaway sings well, Russell Crowe (famously) does not. He has the range of a bull moose snorting angrily through a foghorn. Most of the cast try really hard with this material, but major plot points are obscured (or ignored) by poor writing. It is never a good idea to render an entire story, with all its dialog, in music. If you don't want every detail shouted at you in feverish pitch, avoid this thing like the plague. I kept waiting for this to get better - and it never, ever did. The production values are OK, but the whole thing seems endlessly long, and by the end, I was just waiting for the whole mess to be over! Don't waste your time - see the wonderful 1930s version (no music there, thank God) with Fredric March and Charles Laughton (as the evil inspector). A true classic, that was. \n",

But instead of doing the music first and getting an ultimate flavor of the wonderful score, they decided to experiment and do the singing \"live\" -- that is, while the film was rolling, rather than mouthing to pre-recorded tunes. With the stars singing as they act, actors are guiding the music! Furthermore, it means when they're walking around their voices waver. Try singing and walking! I'm all for experimentation in the movies, but to take one of the biggest products ever to hit Broadway, whose music is beloved of millions, and to experiment in a movie of this scope was ridiculous, and it simply didn't work.\n",

The first was to lose that great harmony at the end between the ghosts of Fantine and Eponine, which is always beautiful (and what happened to Fantine's hair? Usually, she is restored to her full beauty when she comes back as a ghost.) The second dumb decision was, in the reprise of \"Do You Hear the People Sing\" to show an endless barricade, hung with French flags. Frankly, and this might just be me, I find the idea that Heaven is a kind of barricade absolutely repulsive. Because of this idiotic image (which, admittedly, was beautifully done) I won't even have a copy of this flick in my house. Shame on you! Shame!\n",

Losing the Act structure meant they might have feared they couldn't have a climax at that time in the film, so they downplay the whole thing, but I didn't find it at all exciting or moving (and since they were comic relief, would it have been too awful, after some of the imagery presented in \"Master of the House,\" to have the Thenardiers stick their heads up out of a sewer grating like they do on stage, which is always good for a laugh?\n",

Just to get inside Marius' head for a moment! Criminy, people, don't movie-makers have any imagination these days?

            "503 )  I don't remember when I found out about Les Miserables was being made into a film but I recall being fairly excited. I was just coming into the world of musicals and this would be one of the first I properly became invested in. Upon watching the film I found it quite upsetting (which was to be expected, of course), though I'm sure the proper term is uplifting as we do know the outcome of the French Revolution. The acting on Jackman's part was acceptable and carried the film throughout the plot, as well as his impeccable singing which by all measures made him a perfect casting choice. After its release many people criticised Crowe's singing voice however I feel that his portrayal of the morally tormented police inspector far outweighed the sour notes he may have displayed. By far the most enjoyable part of the film was the relationship between Helena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen's characters, the Thenardiers who lightened the mood on the mostly saddened tone the film expresses. When it comes to criticisms I have for the film I have two main worries, one of which is Amanda Seyfried who (based partly on my views on her due to previous movies) failed, I believe, to match the standard the rest of the ensemble managed to uphold. This, unfortunately, left a rather distressing amount of emotional aspects unexplored. The other concern I hold for the film is its reliance on the singing-on-set technique which, I'm sure, encouraged many of it's viewers to witness. This left the film without any other unique strategies and made it lose heart when the film- making is considered. However, Redmayne, Barks and Tveit shone throughout the piece and pulled the slightly disjointed plot into an amalgamation of emotion, drama and song. \n",

With a budget of $61 million, the film would eventually but deservedly win three Academy Awards and three Golden Globes and gross a worldwide total of $441 million plus. To the English-speaking world, the book's title is referred to in its original French, while several alternatives, however, have been used as well, including 'The Miserable', The Wretched', 'The Miserable Ones' and 'The Wretched Poor'among others. So does this beautiful and breathtaking blockbuster, a musical feast for the eyes and ears,possibly then remain unsung? Let's take a look.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film begins in 1815 and continues on to culminating in the 1832 June Rebellion in Paris, following the lives and interactions of several characters, particularly the struggles of ex-convict 24601 or Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) and his experience of redemption near the film's end, as he is about to die in a church, questioning his own life's morals and choices. The film also adapts many natures from the novel as well, examining the nature of law and grace, elaborating the history of France, Paris' then urban design, politics, moral philosophy, antimonarchism, justice, religion and exploring the nature of romantic and familial love.\n",
            "\n",
            "Set against the backdrop of 19th-century France, 'Les Mis' opens with Jean Valjean, a Frenchman released on parole after serving nineteen years at Toulan Prison for stealing a loaf of bread for his starving family (originally it was five years but the sentence was elongated due to his running away). Eight years later, he becomes a factory owner and mayor of Montreuil, Pas-de-Calais, adopting Cosette (eventually Amanda Seyfried) from living with the Thenardier twosome (Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter), an unscrupulous pair of swindling innkeepers, and their daughter Eponine (eventually Samantha Barks). Cosette is the daughter of Fantine (Anne Hathaway), one of his struggling establishment workers-turned-prostitute, of whom was trying to raise money for her ill child. All the while and for decades now, ValJean is pursued by the ruthless police inspector Javert (Russell Crowe), devoting his entire life to incarcerating ValJean once again in shackles with the chain gang. Nine years later, poverty increases in Paris, and Jean Maximilien Lamarque is the only government official sympathetic towards the poor, thus causing a group of young revolutionary students, known as the Friends of the ABC, to plan a rebellion of the French monarchy. One of them, Marius Pontmercy (Eddie Redmayne) falls for the fair and beautiful Cosette, where, unbeknownst to them singing at her gate together, Eponine watches secretly in the shadows, also yearning for his love in return but realizing it was never meant to be. Once the rebellion commences, this leads up to the climactic and powerful fight for freedom, as all the souls shot down in the battle are reunited and sing triumphantly at the holy barricade on the other side and waving the French tricolor victoriously before the end credits roll.\n",
            "\n",
            "'Les Mis' is no doubt a magnificent feat for director Tom Hooper, along with cast and crew. The film boasts fifty-one songs in total, as most of the numbers are phenomenal as each note is sung with a longing passion straight from the depths of the human spirit, including: \"I Dreamed a Dream\", \"Suddenly\", \"One Day More\", \"On My Own\", \"Red and Black\" and \"Do You Hear the People Sing?\" Every single song was recorded live on set to capture the spontaneity of the performances, and the actors wore ear pieces which fed the sound of a live piano being played off-stage to keep their singing in key. Hugh Jackman even went thirty-six hours without water, causing him to lose water weight in his checks and eyes, allowing him to display the gaut appearance of a prisoner, and Anne Hathaway's performance at audition reportedly blew everyone away, leaving them in tears and eventually winning her an Academy Award and a Golden Globe. Originally aiming for a four-hour running time (as compared to the 1934 film) and fifteen minutes of battle sequence, the film was cut to two and a half hours with fifteen minutes of the final film was cut out. 'Les Mis' was the first film in a decade to win an Academy Award nomination since 'Chicago' (2002). Critics had their own say afterwards, leaving a C plus rating as one sites' consensus reads: \"Impeccably mounted but occasionally bombastic, Les Miserables largely succeeds thanks to bravura performances from its distinguished cast.\" Danny Cohen's cinematography made a point in 'The King's Speech' showing the awkward relationship between England's Prince Albert \"Bertie\" (Colin Firth) and speech therapist Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) upon their first meeting, whereas here in 'Les Mis', for some scenes, the camera-work repeats this for no reason, where other times the camera jerks about wildly, allowing many pivotal moments to become lazy and unfocused.

Anne Hathaway deserved the Oscar 100% and I was mad that Hugh Jackman didn't win for best actor and the film for best picture. I thought they deserved it fair and square. And the Oscar performance from the les mis cast was beautiful. It was so nice to see everyone together! What I really loved about the film is the chemistry between everyone. Though Valjean and Javert played cat and mouse with each other, they are best friends off screen. I also heard that the girl cast members would sing karaoke when they were not filming. I felt the connection. It was real. I didn't mind that most of the dialogue is sung. I have to say that I cringed at some moments (sorry guys), but it gives it more of a natural feel. The acting is spot on. I easily felt the emotion the characters gave off, which was why I felt like I was in 1800's France. I also realized there was a Broadway musical and a couple of concerts along with a book (yes they all came before the movie, but I had no clue until after I've seen the film). I have not read the book yet (it's over 1000 pages!), but I have seen it on Broadway and seen the concert (even the one with Nick Jonas, which I LOVED --> I was a Jonas Brothers fan back in the day).

Nothing beats seeing the volume of live singers on stage singing One More Day and Do You Hear the People Sing. The film can't capture close to this. Aside from that stylistically, I disliked the number of close ups and found the fact that they went in and out of focus as the performer moved singing irritating. Really pulled me out of the film. \n",

            "511 )  I've seen and enjoyed this play a couple of times. But I really did not enjoy this version in the least. The main question that comes to my mind is why in God's name was Russell Crowe cast in this? His singing is truly awful! Jackman is only slightly better. Other than Anne Hathaway, the singers suck. This hurt my ears to the point that the director should be shot for casting them. The dark visuals are appropriate, though it does tend to drag on and on in the darkness. Of course, this is not a bright and happy play, so I don't expect this to be happy or anything. But it shouldn't hurt my ears, and, in fact the other performances have been sonically pleasant to my ears. \n",

            "512 ) Very incredible movie that I watched in my life. I loved a lot.... A give 100 stars for Hugh Jackman, and also for the brain behind this movie.. Expecting more from him.. Hooper's idea to have the actors sing live really brings a deeper emotion to the film not seen in other movie musicals. Hugh Jackman is absolutely incredible as Jean Valjean and carries the film with spectacular grace. Anne Hathaway is magnificent in her fleeting role as Fantine - the film's sequence in which she goes on a downward spiral is one of the it's best moments, and her ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE HEARTFELT rendition of 'I Dreamed A Dream' will win her the Oscar by itself.\n",

            "513 ) Part of the trouble with Les Mis is trying to sum up the entire French Revolution in a musical, which is a strange, even absurd idea. I still prefer the stage version - it has less pretension that this is realistic. As others have said, the CGI in the movie is over-done. The songs and characters don't need over the top design and effects - it's as if the producers felt they had to throw money at each scene and crowd the screen with people and buildings and objects. The Thenardiers' comic Master of the House, for example, was overly elaborate, whereas the lyrics and the couple alone are amusing enough without so many pranks. The casting is uneven. I am not a fan of Hugh Jackman, but he can sing, if not beautifully, and Jean Valjean would have been hard to cast. Anne Hathaway is OK as Fantine but it's a rather pathetic character and not a great stretch for her. Amanda Seyfried is a bit shrill as the older Cosette but again has a bit of a pathetic role. Eddie Redmayne is wonderful as Marius. Not the conventional hunk, but a lovely singer with a good strong screen presence. The other male rebels have those gorgeous rich voices required of all those revolutionary songs. The children playing young Cosette and Gavroche are great. The woman playing the older Eponine has a nice voice and her songs are done well. But she's not convincing in her death scene. Too healthy looking. The technique of the actors singing live is a stroke of genius. Witness brilliant songs like Do You Hear the People Sing or Red and Black and Drink With Me. They're lush and fresh. I had heard that Russell Crowe can't sing but that rumour was wrong. He's not Pavarotti but he acquits himself well in a demanding role as Valjean's nemesis, Javert. The barricade scenes take a while to pick up. They stop and start too much. Les Mis is a hard movie to film, but I felt it could have been done much better. \n",

            "514 ) This is truly one of the worst movies of all time. It's a musical but most of the cast can't sing a note. The fact is that they sing anyway and it's torture for your ears.

            "\n",
            "Eddie Redmayne is probably the only one who not only sings fine but also is a good actor with a lot of resources. The rest is forgettable, even the great Anne Hathaway, who hasn't enough time to conceive her dramatic part. \n",

            "515 )  Les Miserables turned out to be one of the best musical dramas that I have seen in years (I am not a big fan of the high school musical series) and the praise that this film getting is what it truly deserves. The Movie follows the story of a thief, Jean Valjean(Hugh Jackman),who finds redemption after he is left dubious about his ideas of hate and love by an act of kindness. Everything about him changes and he decides to be a man of good for once,while he is being dogged by the police officer, Javert( Russel Crowe), who believes that criminals are always criminals(he claims to have been born in prison but he is not one). The rest of the story is how Jean becomes responsible for Fantine's (Anne Hathaway) death and pledges to raise her daughter while being chased by the justice maniac Javert amidst the dawn of the French revolution. When he finds out that his adopted daughter Cosette (Amanda loop Sayfried) is in love with a young rebel named Marius (Eddie Redmayne), Jean must decide what to do. The whole atmosphere of the French Revolution is really immersive and actually pulls you into feeling the tension that exist between the rich and the poor. Tom Hooper has brought out a perfect looking movie that is truly a spectacle to watch. Here and there a few problems creep up,one which I felt was the length of the film and some of the dialogues(songs I mean) felt a little stretched. Despite these tiny annoyances, this film keeps your attention through it's beautiful visual story telling and terrific performances by its cast. Even when the songs get a little tiring their performances drive it to the finishing line. Some aspects of the movie like the love triangle( sort of ) between Cosette, Marius and Epoine ( Samantha Barks) didn't get the seriousness that it was trying to portray and I felt Epoine lamenting about lost love fell on deaf ears. Also the Thenaedier couple got a bit more screen time than what they needed. But other than that the movie is brilliant to watch.Hugh Jackman , Russell Crowe and Anne Hathaway nail it. Especially Anne Hathaway's performance screams for an Oscar. Even little Cosette shines a symbol of innocence and truth amidst the social decay of France. It the actors who stand out remarkably in the film and by far I believe that it is one of the best chosen cast. This is a movie that every movie lover should watch. So get ready for a lifetime of Fight, Dream, Hope and Love. \n",

            "516 )  Who gives this less than an eight? Maybe because of Russell Crowe trying to sing but you know what....good for him. He went out of his element and put himself on the national stage by taking a leap. Which one of us wouldn't take a leap for something we wouldn't want to do. I also don't believe in God yet I love this movie. Music is fantastic. Anne Hathaway is fantastic, Aaron Tveit is fantastic. Hugh Jackman can sing and act his heart out. My girlfriend had been recommending this musical for a long time and I simply dismissed her ideas- after all what guy likes singing and musicals and history? After recommending this to my friends...all giant sports and non-musical fans...we found ourselves talking about it on Superbowl Sunday. This movie is highly recommended to anyone. \n",
            "\n",
            "517 )  This is by far my favorite film due to its excellent music, acting, and story line. The first aspect that especially caught my attention was the fact that the actors sang the entire film live. Not only did they do a fantastic job vocally, but this aspect made this film unique from the rest. Secondly, the directors did an excellent job in casting for the film. Each actor/actress was a perfect fit for each roll and they did a great job portraying the character through their personality, costumes, and mannerisms. Lastly, the directors did a great job in turning a well-known play into an enjoyable film. Although it is common for people to be disappointed after watching a film that is based off of a play, this film exceeds many expectations. I would personally recommend this film to anyone who has read the novel, seen the live performance, or just loves musicals in general! \n",

            "518 ) I saw Les Miserables on Broadway some years ago and had very mixed feelings about it. The production had some emotional power: the funny scenes were funny, the sad scenes were sad, the stirring scenes were generally stirring. That said, I decided I didn't like the musical because I simply don't like the plot. I haven't read the original story, I hasten to add -- maybe it was better as literature. But the plot of the musical is hard to buy into. The main characters make a habit of doing things that make no sense. They are self-destructive in a way that seems to be almost like an ancient Greek drama: the Fates have decreed that so-and-so must suffer, and so suffer he shall. On and on, for his whole life. And his children's children unto the seventh generation.\n",

            "Now on to the movie version. I give some points to the producers for attempting to get a live feel to the performances. It is a conversion of a stage play, after all. Still, I don't think the effort really works. The camera angles are all wrong, and made me feel cramped and dirty. I don't really want to enter that world viscerally, I guess.\n",
            "\n",
            "Much has been made of the fact that the performers were basically film actors rather than stage performers. I don't think that's necessarily a disqualifier, but it does create problems. Singing on pitch is only part of the challenge, after all. The singer's art also encompasses feeling and nuance. The skills required to do that on film don't always correspond to what it takes on stage. In any event, the singing just didn't work for me in this version. When you decide to film a production in which every word is sung, that's a problem.\n",
            "\n",

            "519 ) This was not at all the right film for me because I love listening to beautiful singing and this was the exact opposite. Tom Hooper is a very capable director but getting untrained voices to handle this score was a total mistake. It is constantly painful to hear them simply barking out the lines, and it's not helped by the fact that the lines themselves are so thoroughly banal. The excellent acting, detailed recreation of 19th c. France and brooding drama of Hugo's great tale do not succeed in overcoming the agony of the so-called singing, which ruined some fine songs (though in truth there are not that many). For me hell would be having to sit through endless films in which Helena Bonham-Carter does her 'get me, I'm a little slut' act. Ugh\n",

Tom Hooper's version will captivate the audience with an explosive cast, delivering emotional performances. The risky approach, Hooper takes with the non-stop singing performances seems to pay off, supported by gritty aesthetic and well represented costumes and settings, to transport you back in time. Jackman and Crowe complement each other with strength and bravery, portrayed through their unexpectedly impressive vocals. This is supported by Anne Hathway, the emotional stand alone feminist with her unbeatable rendition of I dream a dream. (Watch out Su-bo!)

I was so upset that George wasn't able to have his shining moment in Drink With Me: probably the most meaningful and emotional solo from the Les Amis/barricade boys. Sam was amazing, as always, but very very \"diluted\" probably because the female \"stars\" of the film are supposed to be Anne and Amanda, but Sam is better than both of them so they had to make her look worse...Aaron was great, but I feel like they turned down his vocals or something? He has a really powerful belt, sort of like Ramin Karimloo, but it just didn't seem as powerful as it usually is.

Anne Hathaway was superb in belting out her rendition of \"I Dreamed A Dream\" while Russell Crowe's portrayal of Jean's pursuer Javert was done incredibly well with own singing performance. Samantha Barks did splendidly well as Eponine as the love rival to Amanda Seyfried's Cosette for Eddie Redmayne's Marius. But I say that the real show stealers goes to the kids themselves.

Huttlestone would have stolen the full movie if were not for Samantha Barks stunning portrayal of Eponine.\n",
            "\n",
            "Barks plays Eponine with such sweetness, grace, and sadness that it is hard to imagine anyone else in the role, she is heartbreakingly beautiful. Her hauntingly beautiful performance of \"On My Own\" is my favourite of the full movie. And that is saying something as it is filled with songs both beautiful and catchy. I could spend another five paragraphs singing the praises of Barks. But I'll stop here. I'll definitely be looking out for her in the future. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.\n",

            "\n",
            "There's always a \"but\", though. Casting, in my opinion, is what cost the Oscar for this movie. Russell Crowe looked scared and sounded like he had nasal issue; he did not meet the expectations of the masculine Javert, which is why I felt a little relief during \"Javert's Suicide\". Amanda Seyfried was innocent, like Cosette is supposed to be, but her voice was too small. Hugh Jackman would've made a great Javert, and really brought a grand perspective to Jean Valjean.\n",
            "\n",
            "The make-up and costuming was outstanding and really brought out contrast between rich and poor; sick and healthy. And all the death scenes were well produced (Fantine's Death, Little People or Gavroche's Death, A Little Fall of Rain or Eponine's death, the Final Battle Scene). Overall, it was true to the story and is really worth seeing 9/10 \n",

When raising her daughter the french revaluation is at its peak. When they are walking Cosset finds a boy named Marius.When Marius and a group of students begin protesting against the government and construct a barricade. This movie is compacted with amazing music a solid cast of characters and is worth watching over and over again. \n",

            "532 )  I must say that I used to think that Cosette was the most Miserable one of \"Les Miserables\" but when I watched this movie ... Oh man! I cried a lot for Eponine! Especially when she said while dying \"You're here. That's all I need to know!\". It' probably the saddest scene I've ever scene since the last moments of \"The Mist\". I liked Samantha Barks more than Amanda Seyfried and I think she acts better as a Miserable. I'm like her too I guess. But beside all that Eponine-stuff this movie is a masterpiece in my opinion. I don't wanna praise it because it's already got a lot of acclaim. I just wanted to say that Eponine is my hero in the movie, not Valjean, but 'Ponine. Thank you Ms. Barks. \n",
            "\n",
            "533 ) I had no desire at all to watch this film, even after countless trailers and clips I watch of the film. My drive went from zero to a minus ha. However, I thought to myself, I'm setting up a Movie Blog I need to expand my horizons a bit and watch films I wouldn't usually watch. So here is my review for the film in my heart I knew I would despise.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tom Hooper usually makes films that do not peak my interest, they are very much award orientated films and that's just not me.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film revolves around an ex-convict known Jean Valjean (Jackman) as he tries to reinvent his life after he is convicted with petty theft, now trying to become a very model citizen. No matter how hard he may try, Inspector Javert (Crowe) a very dedicated lawman who will take down his man no matter how well his life has turned around.\n",
            "\n",
            "Valjean's life is now better than he probably ever expected, he's now a very wealthy man, mayor of his town and Javert accidentally comes across him, both mean realising who the other is setting up a long and arduous chase by Javert to catch his man. Even if that means decades of chasing and hunting him throughout a student uprising resulting in pretty severe war time.\n",
            "\n",
            "The film is acted beautifully by the entire cast and I usually shy away from praising an entire cast, however I can't say anybody in this film gave a less than stellar performance. Jackman portrays a very wounded and pain driven man, his best acting performance to date.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, I can HIGHLY recommend this film to anybody who is a fan of this kind of film, it may be long but there is no point in which you're thinking about time. However, you will definitely need a toilet break at some point. My favourite performance from the entire film came from unknown Samantha Barks playing Eponin, she was a revelation, hope she goes onto much bigger things. \n",
            "\n",
            "534 )  Admittingly, while I enjoy some musicals, Les Mis was more operatic and lost me early. That being said, the cinematic story is rich, if not dark, and thankfully allowed some room for humor. The performances were a mixed bag, but I bought into the Hugh Jackman experience while I found Russell Crowe to be a but flat. Again, the story being completely told through non-song singing took too much energy to follow. If this were in French with sub-titles I could possible be raving about it. It is a Frenck story, no? I'll watch it again down the line, but no rush. I mentioned my disappointment to my on-line community and those who saw it live were shocked, but many who, like me, were DVD only viewers, the experience did not \"take me away\". This is a sad tale told through non-stop singing. If that sound good to you, then enjoy! \n",
            "\n",
            "535 )  I have seen Les Mis live on a couple of occasions so I knew the movie was not going to be an opera on the big screen. Using opera stars would have made it a big screen opera and it would have bombed since it offered nothing new. I also doubt that opera stars would have been able to handle the rigors these actors went through while carrying a tune...in my opinion. These actors brought the characters to life in ways no one else could. They showed the trials endured during this time period better than any book I have ever read. The singing parts ranged from good to excellent and I am impressed they were able to both sing and act their parts. I have seen it three times and the songs are still in my head they were so moving. Once you realize it's not Wolverine singing you get a 9 star rating for cast and story! I also suggest watching it with the closed captions on at least once. I missed a bit of the lyrics the first time around. \n",
            "\n",
            "536 ) I loved this as a musical and Tom Hooper did an amazing job bringing the musical to the big screen. I thought all of the performances were also fantastic especially Anne Hathaway and Amanda Seyfried because unlike the others they didn't have any musical theater background whatsoever under the belts. No Mama Mia doesn't count because it was prerecorded and used auto-tune. I doubted Crowe at first and while he wasn't amazing, he did the best he could. He simply did not have the right voice or training to play such a powerful character. Anne obviously blew everyone away. Barks was only as good as she should have been, I mean she played Eponine on stage if she wasn't as good as she was that would have been shameful. Redmayne and Jackman were strong and belted out when needed. Carter and Cohen were amazingly funny and added much needed comic relief. Overall very well done.\n",
            "\n",
            "Side note: I hate when people say Seyfried didn't deserve the part of she wasn't good enough.\n",
            "\n",
            "1. If you read the book Seyfried with slightly browner hair IS Cosette. From head to toe, innocent. If she didn't look the part I don't know who would because their likeness is uncanny.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. People say she has a thin voice and cannot hold her notes. Does anyone else in the movie have such impossibly high notes?\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Cosette and Eponine were the two most auditioned roles in the whole film and Amanda beat out apparently over 1, 769 other actresses and singers hoping for the role. So get over it! \n",

            "537 )  Les Miserables is a heart-felt story about an escaped convict during the French Democratic Revolution. Jean Valjean, the escaped convict played by Hugh Jackman, sang soulfully about his struggles but also triumphantly how he turned his life around. When he gave his soul to God, he vowed that he had a duty to be a better person and to serve others. The character was well-played by Jackman because his appeal was infectious. Other characters in the movie, such as Fantine played by Anne Hathaway, touched many hearts in the audience. Through loud sobs and gasps, Hathaway sang the famed \"I Dreamed a Dream\" with as much despair and as much feeling as she could. Samantha Barks, Eddie Redmayne, and Amanda Seyfried, also prominent figures in the movie, represented the hardships of love. Barks was a third wheel in the love triangle between Seyfried, Redmayne, and Barks. When Barks's character Eponine sings her iconic song \"On My Own,\" audience members can empathize and relate to her story, and that's what makes her character a protagonist. Lastly, the Revolution was portrayed as a momentous struggle for freedom of democracy, and it really captured the historical essence of the complication. Not all of the big names in the film did a fantastic job singing-wise, but the acting and portrayal of the characters was beyond outstanding. Even to someone who doesn't like musicals, the songs in Les Miserables are catchy and emotion-filled. \n",
            "\n",
            "538 ) The 2012 version of Les Miserables is a dark, rather depressing take on Victor Hugo's classic, but that doesn't mean it's bad. It's full of immense talent and the majority of these actors surprised me because they actually know how to sing. This film will make even the toughest cry just a little, because this is such an emotional story. This is a near-classic that surpasses the last adaptation of Les Miserables in every way.\n",
            "\n",
            "Tom Hooper directs a musical based on the events that took place during the French Revolution of 1848. This is a battle between good vs. the law and more specifically Jean Valijean vs. Javert.

            "\n",
            "The acting is utterly fantastic in this film. This movie couldn't have been made with lesser acting. Anne Hathaway is fantastic and really gives me the chills during her rendition, \"I Dreamed a Dream.\" Hugh Jackman was just as good as Valijean and he moved me with his performance. Russell Crowe was surprisingly good and I was impressed at his singing voice. We also got some great performances out of Amanda Seyfried, Sacha Baren Cohen, and Helena Bonham Carter.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, this is a great, well-done musical version of this classic novel. The production values are top-notch and the songs are wonderfully sung. The original song, \"Suddenly\" was a welcome addition to the film. Don't be ashamed if this makes you cry by the end, because it definitely will. I rate this film 9/10. \n",

In fact I think I watched it like 20 times and now I've memorized it. Really moving and great. At first I didn't know It was a musical but when I saw it, I was like \"WOW\"! I think this movie's way better than that Titanic Movie. It was great and moving but I think this movie deserved those Academy awards titanic won ,too. I think that this movie should be in the top rated ones, too I mean it really teaches you so many things, in fact it taught me so many things because well I'm 15 and it really makes a lot of sense to me and makes me realize so many things. I really liked the role of Javert played by Russell Crowe, one of the greatest actors ever. It was a moving character and I really wanted to read the novel and had in mind of watching the film and out of nowhere once I watched it and for 2 days I couldn't watch anything else. This happened to me with The Godfather, The Dark Knight and Gladiator and also A Beautiful mind and L.A. Confidential. I highly recommend people who haven't seen this movie yet to watch it. \n",
            "\n",
            "540 )  Although I had never seen \"Les \"Mis\" before, I was very eager to see the movie. I do like musicals and it looked like a very good story as well. I absolutely loved the music and how passionate the performances were by the actors. I actually liked the fact that the majority of the film was sung. It brought a certain emotion to it that simply can't be felt by talking. The story was very touching and it was a joy to see the transformation of Jean Valjean. It was amazing to see that he could go from a prisoner with nothing to a man who changes his life and becomes a father to a young girl who is in desperate need. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is definitely worth watching. \n",

Starting with the cruelty of the people who imprisoned people for some small stuff and yet freeing them as dangerous men leading to their dis- acceptance in the society. Soldiers in that time, as the movie shows, were like machines, bodies that work for the government with not a little pit of conscience. Starting with a thief, Hugh Jackman ended up to be guided to God by a priest.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the start the movie compels the audience to watch more. Time later shows how cruel the people were, for instance firing a woman because she had a child with no marriage, even though she begged that she needed money to pay for the people who her child lives with. The thing that started the fight and made the helper of Hugh Jackman to fire her was the jealousy the women had against her, Anne Hathaway.\n",
            "\n",
            "I consider Anne Hathaway to be a brave woman who would cut all her hair for a movie, even though she wasn't obliged to. Other than her hair, she have lost so much weight in order to act in this movie. Very few actors who would do such a thing. Through her scenes, Anne, as her character, showed so much bravery by doing such indecent things to gain a little amount of money.\n",
            "\n",
            "Russel Crowe is a typical example of a machine for the government, he abides to the law with his whole heart. As the revolution started I thought for a second that he went against the government by helping the revolutionists, but at the end he appeared to be as a spy.\n",

            "Daniel's Huttlestone role grabbed my attention, he was a very brave actor. He stood with all grown up men, sang with them like it is all normal for him, knowing that he was the only child at the parts he appeared in.\n",

            "Another part that also grabbed my attention was the family that Cossete lived with. They started with stealing even so they had a place where they can get money, and ended up to be on the streets yet they kept stealing. One more thing about them was of how their daughter was the total opposite of them, decent that is, she helped a man she loved to see the woman he loved.\n",
            "\n",
            "What I liked in the movie was, it was all singing, even the dialogue was made out of singing, you might barely find any dialogue with no singing. Another thing I liked was the tone of the songs, most of them had very close tones to each other. And notice that the songs were sung live, not a playback. I also liked the pattern the movie was set on.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the other hand, there were things I disliked in the movie. I didn't like the early death of Anne Hathaway, and how Russell Crowe didn't care about her death and wanted to catch Hugh Jackman. One more thing I disliked was the length of the movie, it was too long that at the end it becomes somehow boring to some people.\n",
            "\n",
            "The buildings, streets, shops were all describing the correct time that is, 1800s. Overall, the movie had a great setting, well developed actors, and it was so inspirational. \n",
            "\n",
            "542 ) When I first watched this movie I was a bit skeptical as to how it would turn out, after all, when a movie has to include so many famous actors and actresses in it, it generally spells disaster and the writing and directing fall so short that the movie is a train wreck, nothing short of abominable. With Les Mis, not so.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hugh Jackman did a fantastic job with his role as the incredibly conflicted Jean Valjean and Anne Hathaway was brilliant as well, even though we didn't see much of her. My personal favorite character though was Javert.\n",

            "Russell Crowe did a phenomenal job with his part and I really enjoyed seeing a different side to Javert, not just the evil man that a lot of actors portray when they play the part. All in all I really couldn't call him a villain because he was so convinced that Valjean was the criminal and when he finally came to terms with the fact that Valjean had changed it wasn't that he just didn't want to believe it, it was that he had wasted umpteen years of his life chasing down a man who proved that everything he believed was false.\n",
            "\n",
            "The music was wonderful and some of the sets they had were breathtaking. I thoroughly enjoyed the rooftop scene when Javert was singing Stars because it was just a really beautiful scene.\n",

It showed Gavroche, Fantine, and Eponine as well as some revolutionaries all in an endless barricade. Heaven is supposed to be a better place but instead everyone still looked gaunt and worn down. The movies highlights were A Heart Full of Love by Eponine, Marius, and Cosette, I Dreamed a Dream by Fantine, and the end song where Valjean dies. The song at the inn was truly hilarious with a few inappropriate scenes for younger viewers. The scene where the revolution actually takes place was quite sad. Some of my favorite characters died. As a previous review said, some of the songs sounded quite like the others and it was sort of confusing. A few of the characters' actions were not very believable and too good to be true. I do believe that some of the casting could have been better. Russell Crowe is not exactly the best singer. Anne Hathaway was great though. Again, I Dreamed a Dream was filled was so much emotion and told a story all on its own. \n",

            "\n",
            "Les Miserables is a drama-filled and emotion packed film that has received a lot of respect since it was released on the 25th of December, 2012 (Hooper 2012). Originally being a musical on Broadway, Tom Hooper, the director, brought it to the big screen. Hooper followed the story line from the Broadway musical pretty tightly and even kept the live musical style to it. Out of the huge number of actors needed to make this film possible, the main and most well known actors were Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, and Russell Crowe who played the three main characters of Jean Valjean, Fantine, and Javert (\"Les Miserables\"). The actors, the live singing, and the set design had a large impact on the success of this film, but what I believe won Les Miserables its 51 awards was its easily relating to story plot featuring a hurting economy, a country in the middle of war, and the struggle of a prisoner trying to get back on his feet.\n",
            "\n",
            "The setting for this movie was France in the mid-1800s. The majority of the people in France like in the movie were facing rough economic hardships. There was a lot of poverty and crimes committed because of the economic situation. In the movie, Anne Hathaway played a mother who did everything she could to support her daughter. When Fantine (Hathaway) was fired from her job working in the factory, she had to resort to anything that resulted into her receiving some type of income. Fantine sold her hair and even sold herself into prostitution just to be able to provide for her daughter (\"Les Miserables\"). This scene often reaches out to many parents' emotions because just like Fantine, most would do anything just to provide for their family. Maybe a father has to work a third job or a family has to mortgage their house, and although these sacrifices are not as dramatic or extreme as falling into prostitution, the same emotions are shared from the characters in Les Miserables to the audience.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Revolution trying to overthrow the French government was also displayed in this movie. Like many of us know, with war comes the sacrifices of many lives for the greater good. When I think of war, I do not just think of fighting and blood, I also think of love. With the Revolution in Les Miserables, a large amount of love is shown between characters and their families. Like in society today, many friends or significant others would take a bullet in order to save the person they love just as Eponine, a friend of Marius, did. With Eponine sacrificing her life for a friend, strong emotions are presented to the audience. War veterans and families of war heroes, are immediately connected and engaged in the movie because they can somehow relate themselves to one of the members of the Revolution. Later in the Revolution, all but one student dies leaving the one surviving with despair and devastation. This feeling of despair and devastation is always seen in families and through veterans when lives are lost. Because Hooper was able to engage and connect his audience with those feelings, he was able to make his movie and the meaning of it so much stronger.\n",
            "\n",
            "One last component Hooper was able to correlate with his audience in order to make the movie successful was the struggles of a convict trying to get back on his feet. According to Fox43, a little over 60 percent of inmates return to prison within three years of being released. Seeing Jean Valjean's experience, the audience is able to correlate the hardships that recently released inmates experience. Just as Javert kept a close watch on Jean Valjean, many parole officers and citizens keep a close watch on people that have committed crimes in the past no matter what the present looks like. Just like Jean Valjean, inmates on parole experience struggles of turning their life around and are almost forced to commit another crime just to stay alive. Hooper was able incorporate Valjean's past to show the audience that people can indeed change no matter the circumstances. James Bernardinelli of Reelviews.net stated that Hooper \"draws inspiration as much from the source material as from the musical to result in an engaging production that is guaranteed to enthrall audiences\"(Berardinelli). With the inspiration of Jean Valjean's attempt to recover his footing, the audience is able to become engaged and can relate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Les Miserables is viewed by critics as \"a must see\" and \"spectacular movie.\" This film was able to attain the awards it did by capturing the audiences' emotions and running with them. Hooper used the bad economy, hardships of war, and recidivism as direct connections from the film to its audience and I believe this connection made the film win the awards it did and gain as much success as it gained. \n",
            "\n",
            "546 ) \"The time we live in is a postmodern age where a certain amount of irony is expected. This film is made without irony\" (Wioszcyna, \"Tom Hooper 'confused' by criticism of 'Les Mis'\"). Tom Hooper, director for the box office hit Les Miserables (Hooper, 2012) defended his own film to interviewers when asked what he thought of some critics' response to his movie. Instead of caving to criticism, Hooper owned his movie had no postmodern charm of satire in it. While some critics view it a cheap and cheesy emotional manipulation, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) is a motion picture masterpiece because of the director's innovation in on-screen musicals, honest expression of raw emotions without irony, and the way he portrayed the themes.\n",
            "\n",
            "Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) is an adaption of a Broadway musical to a movie. The complications with adapting a play to a screen are that the camera is a much more flexible medium than a stage and, specifically for musicals, the staged songs can seem forced and inorganic. However, director Tom Hooper and screenwriters were able to overcome theses difficulties. The camera work makes the play come alive as a video production. The singing in the film feels entirely organic because it was filmed on set. The actors actually had earpieces with a piano playing to keep them on key while they were shooting (IMBD.com). While the earpiece itself isn't revolutionary, the piano on the other end created a new way to film musicals. During the movie, the actor or actress singing set the tempo and the piano played along to the tempo he or she sang on camera. By allowing the natural tempo of the actors and actresses to rule the scenes, the songs sound as if the characters wrote them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some critics have pointed to the film's lack of irony as cheap emotional manipulation. However, as the director Tom Hooper pointed out, the object of the film was not to lighten the emotional story by making it satirical (Wioszcyna, \"Tom Hooper 'confused' by criticism of 'Les Mis'\"). Through singing, the audience has a different emotional experience than in most movies. Crafted without irony in the plot, the movie sets a different tone. As New York Times critic Stanley Fish pointed out, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) defeats irony by not allowing the distance it requires. If you're looking right down the throats of the characters, there is no space between them and you; their perspective is your perspective...\" (Fish, \"'Les Miserables' and Irony\"). Because the film keeps the audience in the world of the performer, irony would have been out of place for the movie, and the director made a wise decision to leave the tone out.\n",

            "The themes in Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) would not have been conducive for irony. The main two characters represent competing themes: mercy and justice. Valjean continually shows mercy to those around him after his turning point at the priest's house, Javert's anthem is always justice- to give each what is his due. At the end of the film, the resolution between the two competing morals shows that it is better to forgive and forbear. While rated PG13 by the MPAA (IMDb.com), the lessons in the movie are actually very relevant for any age. Because of violence and some sexuality, the film is not advised for small children but the story and the themes teach important values.\n",
            "\n",
            "Through the moving songs, the themes were really the highlight of the film. With the emotion of poetry, each line exuded what that character stood for and it displayed characters through a different light than prose script would have shown them. By using the tempo the singer or actor set on film, the organic notes accented the point of the story: mercy triumphs over justice. If irony had been written into the tone of the movie, it would have lessened the power of the words in the songs and detracted from that main theme. Each part of Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) highlights the main struggle between Javert and Valjean, making it a masterpiece. None of this would have been possible without the abilities of Tom Hooper as director and his vision for the film.\n",

            "An excellent example of his expertise in directing, Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) shows Tom Hooper's innovation on screen, his wise judgment on the tone, and his masterful way of accenting and portraying the themes of the plot. Hooper's decisions to create the film, knowing it could incite some criticism, shows that he is a masterful director willing to look outside of the box for solutions in order to create something he can proudly defend to critics. Innovation in the techniques and tone, make Hooper's Les Miserables (Hooper 2012) worthy of the Oscars that it won.\n",

            "547 ) Who knew that Hugh Jackman or Anne Hathaway had such great vocal talent? As soon as I began Les Miserables, I was immediately entranced by the voices and scenery that was pictured on screen. The actors, cinematography, and costuming instantly threw me back in time during the period of the French Revolution. Director Tom Hooper portrayed each aspect of this movie with such precision that not one character trait or object was out of sync with the era. The story unfolds over many years in 19th century France, as the impoverished and middle class attempt to revolt against the monarchy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The movie begins with the musical talent of Hugh Jackman, who plays Jean Valjean a prisoner set free after being confined to a life of dishonesty. But his life quickly changes as he chooses to pursue a journey towards redemption after breaking his parole. The events that progress afterward ultimately lead him to his final salvation with God, as he watches over Cosette, daughter of Fantine. After experiencing an awful childhood Cosette, played by the talented Amanda Seyfried, pursues a life of happiness that her mother always dreamed for her. The love that Fantine has for Cosette is so strong it is hard to portray on screen, but the actress behind the role had no issue.\n",
            "\n",
            "Academy Award winner - Anne Hathaway plays the dramatic role as Fantine, a middle-class woman, who gives up just about everything - and I mean everything - to save her daughter. To say that Hathaway can sing is an understatement because anyone listening to her is directly drawn to her character and the story in which she is telling. Her song \"I Dreamed a Dream\" is filled with such raw emotion that even the most impassive person could empathize for this woman. But not to just give credit to Anne Hathaway, the whole cast had such mesmerizing voices that were so real and believable it was if was I was experiencing every little thing that they were going through. Not to mention that director Tom Hooper had each actor sing live during the screening process, meaning every voice heard on screen was real.\n",
            "\n",
            "To me this is the key to a great movie, believability, not allowing one part of the film to fall short of another, and I can vouch for Director Tom Hooper when I say that he did just that. From the original novel, to the Broadway stage version, to a previous movie adaptation, and now to Hooper's film revision, this classic tale has been used a lot. It is hard to keep the depth of a storyline when various directors attempt to draw a different type of audience, but Hooper was able to maintain all the key components to this historical masterpiece. Every scene, costume, song, and character flowed so well together that it was if you were to read straight from the original novel itself. There's a strong complexity of emotion that needed to be kept from scene to scene, and the costuming and scenery only developed the passion within. The tiniest effects made the greatest difference in this timeless tale of Les Miserables. The dirt under the fingernails, the worn and tattered clothing, and the off kilter buildings only emphasized the tiredness and rebellion of the era.\n",
            "\n",
            "This modern remake of Les Miserables is a groundbreaking production in the film industry; thanks to its talented cast and accurate portrayal of the French Revolution era during 19th France. Director Tom Hooper's precision on the small details of the scenery, costuming, and cinematography only aided in the depth of the storyline, taking the audience back to this day and age. This movie is well worth the ticket, so why wait one day more? \n",
            "\n",
            "548 ) There's little to dislike about LES MISERABLES, an exemplary staging of the long-running West End musical featuring a lavish budget, all-star cast and some great vocals. It's a tale of love and loss, of obsession and hatred played out against the background of revolutionary France, and it's quite simply the best musical to come along for a good few years.\n",
            "\n",
            "Much of the delight comes from the central pairing of Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe, both of whom are better than they've been for a good while. Each actors gives it his all, and they fill their roles with nobility, honour and feeling. I like the supporting cast less - Anne Hathaway is nothing to write home about in my mind, and didn't really deserve that Oscar - but Amanda Seyfried is better than she was in MAMMA MIA and Eddie Redmayne is reliable as always.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a film, LES MISERABLES looks splendid, and THE KING'S SPEECH director Tom Hooper puts every penny of the budget up on screen. The songs are memorable and very well sung by the entire cast, and although I could have done without Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter (both of whom seem to be repeating their parts from SWEENEY TODD) they're not too off-putting. Certainly LES MISERABLES is a winner and one to be rewatched and enjoyed all over again in future years. \n",
            "\n",
            "549 )  This classic musical is a masterpiece of course and the movie is also very entertaining, emotional and full of action, but must every little bit be sung it does get a bit annoying I mean the main songs are fine but they could just talk normally at some points like Phantom of the opera that is another great musical but not every little bit is sung, anyway that is the only bad thing really the rest of the movie is fantastic so good I got it on DVD of course my favourite song in the whole musical is I dreamed a dream and one day more them to songs just draw me in more to watch, them songs are the main reason I started watching Les Miserables and I will watch many more times. \n",
            "\n",
            "550 ) Unlike most men, I'm not ashamed to say that I enjoy musicals. Every spring since I was a teenager my family and I would go watch the spring play at the prep school my mom works at. They put on a Broadway level show, no joke.\n",
            "\n",
            "That being said, I was looking forward to Les Miserables. I really like Anne Hathaway and I got goosebumps just watching her performance of \"I dreamed a dream\" in the trailer.\n",
            "\n",
            "The performances are what really carries the film. Hugh Jackman is haunting as Jean Valjean and Russll Crowe adds very stern and rugged vocals to Javert. Anne Hathaway turns in one of the most powerful scenes you will see in a movie all year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Her head is shaven, her eyes are about to burst with tears, she has snot dripping out of her nose. It doesn't get any more vulnerable than that.\n",

            "Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter add some much needed comic relief. Then, a little more than half way through the film, something very interesting happens. Something that makes film so exciting. Les Miserables is stolen from some of the biggest actors Hollywood has to offer by newcomer Samantha Barks who plays Eponine, who's tragically in love with a man who has fallen in love with another woman.\n",
            "\n",
            "Many people are going to have a hard time getting past the fact that everything in the film is sung. Yes...everything. The other problem is that the last act of the film really involves the French revolution. This sometimes seems out of place because the first half of the film really had nothing to do with the war. These are small problems and don't hurt the film.\n",
            "\n",
            "Les Miserables is easily one of the most powerful films of the year, packed with some truly tear-jerking scenes. Guy or girl doesn't matter, go see Les Miserables. \n",
            "\n",
            "551 ) Personally, even though I like musicals and being a musician myself, I thought there was just way too much singing in this movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not to knock the fantastic job the whole cast did. I know Hugh Jackman spent around 14 hours a day singing in shooting for this film, and all the main characters are just stellar at it. (Who knew Russell Crowe could sing a lick, much less do such a good job at it?)\n",
            "\n",
            "I just have a problem in that music - and not all that linear. Some of the lyrics' structures are pretty out there, especially when several stories intertwine, you can't understand a thing - is being used as a CONSTANT vehicle to tell the story, rather than highlight key moments in the drama. For my taste, I just feel the narrative of the story gets gently swept away in all that music, as I do feel the movie would benefit so much more from more constant, traditional storytelling without all that musical weight.\n",
            "\n",
            "But on the flip side, it is a dream cast, every actor is pitch perfect - no pun intended - in their role, the sets and wardrobe are outstanding and Tom Hooper does an amazing job is portraying the griminess of it all, when need be. (Though I could do without some of the independent-y \"alternative\" looking shots scattered throughout)\n",
            "\n",
            "Absolutely no knock on the movie as a whole. Everyone does a wonderful job. For me, it's really just a matter of taste.\n",

            "\n",

            "\n",
            "May I just start by saying that I saw this production on Broadway when I was about ten years old and maybe because of my age, it was never something that appealed to me but now at the tender age of 31, I find myself a lot more open minded. Not remembering the story, I was completely in the dark with what to expect from this movie. Quite honestly I was blown away and found it to be mesmerising.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some reviewers have complained that it's nowhere near as good as the live stage production but I think that these very same people are missing the point. This is an on screen adaptation of the very well known musical and there has to be some sort of bridge here. I'm sure those who live for the theatre would rather have the full Broadway crew cast for the film but for this to work on a more commercial level, you must have some well known actors. Okay, so they can't carry out the songs with the power and intensity of stage performers but you've got to say they did reasonably well considering.\n",
            "\n",
            "The way I see it, for someone like myself who doesn't read books and just thoroughly enjoys film, it's really opened my mind and has given me more motivation now to go to the theatre, more than I ever would before. Like I say it's a bridge between Hollywood and Broadway that I feel works very well. Hats off to the cast who really made this film what it is. Although it may look a bit of an outcast compared to the rest of my collection, this will be one Blu ray I'll be buying very soon.\n",
            "\n",
            "PS. To the reviewer who said that it's ridiculous to get 19 years for stealing bread, had you have been paying attention, you'd know that he was given 5 years for stealing and the rest of his time given was for trying to escape. Please get your facts right before submitting your nonsense. You just end up looking daft. \n",
            "\n",
            "553 ) I have two main problems with this movie. Number one, I think we all know what this one is, Jar Jar. I don't think Jar Jar is bad in all scene, in fact, there are two scenes I actually genuinely find funny. Other than those, he just gets redundant and annoying, and just pointless. The second thing is the Trade Federation. They are trying to get the queen to sign a treaty to make their invasion legal. There is no way to defend this, that is just plain stupid. I don't mind the politics, it's just the fact that the whole storyline is based on taxes and treaties and that crap. The overall storyline moves pretty fast and is relatively exciting. This movie has good effects (for the most part) and has really cool action scenes. There are some line deliveries that the respective actor kind-of butchered, it's not bad, the lines are just stale and dull. The only actors that applies to though are Jake Lloyd and Natalie Portman, but I think they do fine. I don't hate Jake Lloyd as young Anakin, I think he actually perfectly shows what would be a kid Darth Vader. Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Ray Parker all do fantastic in their roles. Ray Parker makes an excellent Darth Maul. I am also a big fan of Darth Maul. So, it is an exciting, and I would say good movie, it just has some dumb things sprinkled in their. \n",
            "\n",
            "554 ) Do not listen to these butt hurt fanboys. This movie is another great addition to the Star Wars universe. Sure, like every movie, it has some flaws, but overall, this movie is an amazing success. People do not understand that the man who created Star Wars in the first place wrote this one as well. This is how HE wanted it to be. Who cares how YOU wanted it to be. If you don't like it, stfu and gtfo. This movie brought amazing new technology from the old Star Wars, and also wrapped up the awesome ties between old and new. It also brought us some awesome new characters. If you didn't like it, sorry. But for me, as well as REAL Star Wars fans, it was a great success. \n",
            "\n",
            "555 ) (This is my review after watching the prequel trilogy in detail for the first time as an adult.)\n",
            "\n",
            "The original trilogy of Star Wars established an immediately recognizable style of visual storytelling that, while constantly being reworked and dumbed down by subsequent special editions, has remained largely intact for the viewers of today. The stories were epic in scope, deftly utilizing archetypal characters and plot arcs, all while wrapping it into a new and exciting \"space opera\" package. This, I think, is how Episode I steps off on the wrong foot. I would argue that the story of Anakin is reasonably compelling in its overall execution; it's more the many less-than-ideal production decisions that detract from the timelessness that defined the originals.\n",
            "\n",
            "Perhaps the most glaring of these choices is the gratuitous overuse of CGI. Please, George Lucas, just stop. His zeal for adding in splashy computer graphics over old practical effects in the special editions has gone completely unchecked here, and since it is the earliest of the three prequel films, the level of advancement in CGI technology had not made it nearly far enough to be a reasonable alternative to practical effects. (The one exception is CGI Yoda, which replaced the original puppet Yoda in the theatrical release who looked even worse.) As a viewer in 2017, the vast majority of these are just inexcusably bad and unnecessary.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm slightly less bothered by how the rest of the story unfolds. For the most part it holds up: the political maneuvering, the crisis on Naboo, the journey to Tatooine and Anakin's struggle to free himself and his mother from slavery, and of course, \"the phantom menace\" of Darth Maul and Palpatine. Somehow the slightly lazier pace of this movie made it feel more realistic, like there wasn't *always* a dire, civilization-threatening crisis going on for these people. There's enough conflict among the characters in their own lives to keep it interesting.\n",
            "\n",
            "That being said, the character development is far below what I would expect from Star Wars. While all the Star Wars movies are very plot-driven, having relatable characters is incredibly important, and the combination of stiff acting and bad screen writing just doesn't cut it here with the likes of Qui-Gon, Anakin, Padme, or God forbid Jar-Jar. And Anakin *really* should have been more like 12 or 13. Having a seven-year-old spout the lines that he did, and with whatever attraction Padme had for him, would have been many times less cringey had he been about five years older.\n",
            "\n",
            "Episode I takes what could've been a successful formula and makes it much less so with poor casting, screen writing, and production. I think if George Lucas and his team had taken this in a more refined, more thoughtful direction, it could have been great. Sadly that wasn't the case. \n",

The one that wrote about people with unexplainable powers, a force flowing through them that is in all living things.

There's only about 15 minutes of counsel meetings in total and I found them rather interesting. They showed how dysfunctional the republic was. That being said, this movie is pretty action packed whether you want to admit or not. Short negotiations, an epic podrace, a race through Naboo, a short first Darth Maul duel, a war between the Gungans and the droids, another race through Naboo and the main palace and of course an epic lightsaber duel. This movie is far from boring. Another reason why this movie is awesome is because during the epic final lightsaber duel, we see Jedi in their prime. In the old Star Wars movies, Jedi were extinct, a myth. In this one, we see them at their most badass.\n",

I'll admit Jar Jar is really annoying but young Anakin not so much and you must be a child with a very small attention span if you thought those 15 MINUTES of counsel meetings were boring. If you're going to destroy this movie as much as the fans did, at least find a valid reason. I'm honest with myself : it was awesome. \n",

            "560 ) When I first rented this movie at my local DVD rental store, I didn't have high hopes for it at first. But that's only because at the time, I had virtually no interest in Star Wars at all. One day after watching a review of the films, I decided to give the movies a try, and see if they were worth all the fame they have. But little did I know that when I first hit 'play' on that DVD menu, i had taken my first step into a larger world.\n",

Now let me just say something for a second: Most people dislike the Prequels for overuse of CGI and not enough real things. But to me, the wonder and mystery of Episodes IV-VI works in a different way. Seeing all of the CGI in the Podrace, the Droids, and a few of the characters, I was stunned. I had never seen CG quality to such an extent before, and much of it really did look real. I had wondered how much work it must've taken to put it all together with the lighting and textures and stuff.\n",

            "Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we can move on. Personally, I didn't really find that much to complain about. I was able to follow the story just fine, and i thought the characters were really interesting. Anakin as a child didn't bother me at all, and i thought he was pretty likable. He had an interesting character, and I kind of actually felt sorry for him since he lived on such a dusty old planet such as Tatooine. When Jar Jar Binks first appeared, I feared the worst based on some of the reviews I saw. But in the first minute or so, Jar Jar actually didn't bother me at all. In fact, I thought he was quite entertaining and funny. For example, when he got his head stuck in the pod race electrical line, I was laughing out of control.\n",

The Naboo Starfighters near the end looked seriously real, the trade Federation battleship looked pretty wicked, and the battle between the gungans and the battle droids looked spectacular, but soon after this happened, came the highlight of the film.

And I thought it was nice to see an update on the lightsaber formula. Anyway, when the fight starts, three key factors make it a great fight. 1 is the music, called Duel of Fates. no words can describe how well this piece of John Williams Gold fits into the fight, and the film in general. The second factor is the movements, or choreography. For the first time, we were introduced to lightsaber duels with back flips, jumps, several hits a second, and some seriously fast paced action, which the Original films seriously lacked from the reviews. And the third thing that makes the fight so great is the location its in. The Theed Palace reactor is such a bad ass place to have a lightsaber fight, its almost as if Darth Maul purposely waited nearby it so they could fight there. Overall, just watch the fight on Youtube and you'll see what I mean.\n",

It is really when you go on and compare it to the other movies of the Star Wars universe, mostly the older movies and Rogue One, that this does not look so good. I wouldn't say it's the worst but I would easily say it's the weakest in terms of helping the series forward.\n",

            "With that aside, I will list off the things I like and don't like here. I believe that the acting is pretty sound for the most part, the man exception just being Natalie Portman who I though that while a great actress, was not really good in this movie or the other two prequels. I have to give Jake Lloyd a pass since he was a kid. But Liam Neeson, Ian McDirmand, and Ewan Mcgregor all did great jobs. The effects were also really amazing and also so for the time. The fight and actions scenes were fantastic. And the planet of Coursant, while the scene on the end of itself is boring, is a really nice setting place.\n",

            "As for negatives, I feel that pacing is way off. I have no problem with the whole political story line or anything since there already was political stories in the Star Wars universe and this expanded it, so maybe that was needed. But with the pacing it's just awful. At one moment we're talking politics then the next we are in a spacehsip to a desert and then we have a race and then we are talking politics again and then we are in a giant battle and then a funeral and how to handle Anakin and then politics again. I just wish that it picked one or two themes and sticked with it.\n",

Science Fiction had always been a major event with moviegoers and in 1977 they would get the thrill of a lifetime because of a film that some felt wouldn't make it. It was followed by two sequels and that appeared to be the end, but that would change over two decades later. The release of the first installment in the new trilogy was one of the most anticipated of all time and people even camped outside movie theatres to see it opening day.

The pod race sequence, which many people refer back to the Chariot Race in \"Ben- Hur\", is amazing. The scene of where Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi are having a lightsaber battle with Darth Maul is impressive.The score especially The duel of fates by John Williams is fantastic The production design is beautiful to look at.

Jake Lloyd, who plays young Anakin Skywalker, is actually a real problem for me. I find his acting completely wooden, and I don't think he delivers anything at all good to the screen. However, I wouldn't want to say that all the actors in this movie are terrible. I think that Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do a fine job of what they're doing. As for the dialogue, it's pretty dreadful. I was actually quite bored by these characters of where they're having these long, serious conversations to one another.\n",

The sheer shittiness of this \"movie\" highlights George Lucas's lack of talent as a director and a writer, and proves once and for all that Star Wars succeeded only because there were people around Lucas who challenged his idiocy. The lack of ambition and imagination that went into the Phantom Menace disgusts me.\n",

            "568 ) For being the most hyped film of its time, You would hope that a film like this would be somewhat satisfying, But in reality this was arguably one of the biggest occurrences where fans would be disappointed.

But the glaring issue with this prequel storyline is that it only seems impactful and interesting until Episode 3.\n",

I wish they would be more like Terminators, not quite exactly like them, but more the ruthlessness and almost unstoppable features, which would make them seem like an actual threat.

            "A aspect that isn't necessary is the movie taking place while Anakin is an 8 year old boy. If they were to make him a little older his overall character would be more relate-able and interesting, Which is one of the things Episode 4 did so well with Luke.

For example, we have the Famous pod-racing segment, Which Anakin volunteers to do since the winning payment will allow the protagonists to buy another hyper- drive system, which is their ticket out of the Outer Rim. But this is clearly there sourly for the purpose of making Video Games based on this specific scene. And Anakin accidentally destroying a CIS control ship just seems unrealistic and strange.\n",

My father who did see the original 3 in the 70s and 80s loved the movies also and as I did loved the remastered movies. He is not what I would call a star wars fan boy by any means of the word, but I consider myself a fan boy and the impact that it had on my father (average movie goer) was very successful. When The Phatom Menace came out I was excited and at the end I WAS NOT AT ALL DISAPPOINTED. I am very tired of people saying that Lucas is bad and should give up, that his movies are bad are you serious? As a story goes it does not reach that of the original but the story that is depicted not only in the phantom menace but in the others are extremely solid. I feel like there is a hatred for these movies for some reason and my only conclusion is that a massive amount of lord of the rings fanboys do not have anything better to do with their time than bash a saga that is way superior then them in every form of the word. I hope that they do release the other 2 prequels and the original trilogy because seeing them on the big screen is something worth paying for. \n",

            "570 ) I just rewatched Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace today as a 24 year old, after first seeing it as about a 10 year old. I genuinely enjoyed watching it and especially loved seeing the beginnings of the Star Wars franchise's plot unfold. I'm not ashamed to say I cried at one part, the progression of the story of Anakin growing up as a slave, being recognized as an almost force of nature so strongly connected to the force, being encouraged to leave his planet and mother to be trained, and ultimately starting his path of pain and sorrow. I think Qui-Gon did not foresee Anakin having such a difficult life and wanted to believe he would bring balance rather than pain to the galaxy. However, Anakin's life never really having stability and his desires to be having never being met hit me hard, I'm not joking. The Star Wars franchise can indeed be entitled \"The Tragedy of Anakin Skywalker,\" and this movie The Phantom Menace sets the plot up so well that Anakin had to go through so much struggle to bring balance and it was difficult to digest imagining that he was *destined* to suffer almost, willed by the Force to destroy the Sith even by helping destroy the Jedi Order and what would inhibit the Jedi from ever defeating the Sith. Watching the movie unfold and observing how Darth Sidious tried to manipulate, successfully, nearly all the events that took place was incredible. I give major points to George Lucas and his, I assume, team of writers, I believe they did a great job in crafting the story. As for Anakin's acting, I'm surprised to say I thought it was good for his place. He is a ~10 year old child and I think for a child actor, he did an extremely good job. I liked the scenes most of all between Anakin and Qui-Gon, he seriously listened and learned from Qui-Gon which most children may not do. I give the film an 8/10, it deserves it, definitely for that last fight scene...probably the best fight scene in all of Star Wars, for myself anyways. Obi-Wan having that energy in his lightsaber duel with Darth Maul after Qui-Gon was nearly dead was amazing, GREAT choreography! Sick~ Long story short: this was a good movie ^^ \n",

Everyone looked forward to the film, and you can't blame them, as the first three Star Wars films were all box office hits, milestones in special effects, and all rightly deserve their classic status. As the writing appeared on screen and the music began, I was fidgeting in my cinema seat with excitement. Unfortunately, Lucas appears to have somewhat lost his touch in the twenty years which have separated the films, and this prequel is nowhere near as good as it could have been.\n",
            "\n",
            "The faults are obvious, and, to a degree, predictable. Predictably enough, there is a visual overload of special effects overwhelming the screen at every opportunity, so many in fact that you soon become immune to the initial amazement of seeing how good they are. They can't be faulted. Every year, CGI just keeps getting better and better and more and more realistic, and the special effects are great. They're not realistic at all, but they look good. I mean, this is the first film to have a computer image as a central character (which freely mingles with the human actors) and in which you really come to forget that it's not real, and you treat it with exactly the same feelings as the actors on screen. Ja Ja Biggs is annoying, yes, but in that respect he is human too. Sadly with so many visual effects bombarding us they quickly become boring, and you realise that the film is desperately in need of some characterisation - a major failing which totally ruins Lucas' intended effect.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the first three films we cared about and felt for Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and all the others, but you don't give a damn in this epic where all the actors do is interact with their computer surroundings and accomplices. And in this way the film is typical of late '90s cinema, where special effects bonanzas like VOLCANO and MEN IN BLACK are full of great FX but little else. In the extended chase sequence in the middle of the film, you get the feel you're watching a video game rather than an actual film, with it looking so unrealistic. Another major fault of the film is that the plot is rather boring. For three quarters of the film not a lot happens, with people talking about tax interspersed with some lame fight scenes, and it's not until the last half an hour that things really hot up and get exciting. I don't know about you, but I never expected Star Wars to be boring. Most scenes appear to be rehashes of moments from the original trilogy, but they're never as interesting, partly because as I mentioned before you don't actually give two hoots about any of the characters.\n",
            "\n",
            "Speaking of the characters leads me on to the actors, obviously an ensemble cast picked from the creme of top Hollywood stars, leading me to wonder if they were in fact picked for their looks rather than their acting ability. For instance, Natalie Portman looks very fragile as the Queen of Naboo, but her acting is barely existent and she is given little to do. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor are top billed as the main stars, but they are given woefully little to do other than walk around, and occasionally jump about a bit. Of the two, Neeson is by far the best, and also my favourite actor in this film. Jake Lloyd appears as a young Darth Vader, but it's difficult to imagine him being remotely threatening, more like a typical American child actor, marginally less whiny than most. Samuel Jackson is given only a couple of scenes, but hopefully he will appear more in the next two films, while Brian Blessed lends only his voice to a comic relief alien character. However it's the returning actors from the original who are the most interesting, and it's great to see Kenny Baker and Anthony Daniels reprise their famous roles as the Laurel and Hardy of the robot world, R2D2 and C3PO. They appear only briefly. Ian McDiarmid reprises his role as the evil Emperor from Return of the Jedi, and is brilliant as Senator Palpatine, the stern but good leader. McDiarmid is very authoritative and successfully mixes his allegiance to good in the role with hints of the powerful, evil figure that he will eventually become.\n",
            "\n",
            "The action sequences in this film range from the mediocre to the poor. The space battles offer nothing new and, to be honest, they were done much better and with more finesse twenty years ago. The light sabre fights with the robots also become boring very quickly, and there are only so many different ways McGregor and Neeson can kill their CGI nemesis. The action happens all very quickly and efficiently, but lacks any sparkle or excitement, or indeed adrenaline. The special effects, probably some of the best CGI I have ever seen in an underwater sequence with gigantic fish attacking a small craft are quite realistic, but I don't think the filmmakers have realised that you need something more than that yet. The music is also very average and the classic themes we all recognise from the first trilogy are sorely underused. The Phantom Menace is disappointing, and nowhere near as good as the originals, but I suppose the mere status of it makes it required viewing, even if it really is this bad. All I can say is that it makes me feel dubious about the next film. Let's hope it's more impressive than this misfiring, below average attempt to rekindle the - much-missed - epic flame. \n",

            "572 ) I really enjoyed this movie, and I really don't get what people have against it. It is interesting, funny, full of action, and has (in my opinion) best lightsaber duel of Star Wars saga (Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan against Darth Maul). I really loved Ewan McGregor, Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman in this movie. I am just disappointed that Darth Maul was killed, I mean yes they returned him in Clone Wars, nut I hoped for more of him in the prequels. Besides that, movie was great. I really loved planet of Naboo, it really looked magnificent. For me, this is the best Star Wars movie, and my favourite movie of all time, and I am huge fan of movies like Star Wars, Harry Potter, Lord Of The Rings, Pirates Of The Caribbean, Donnie Drako, Indiana Jones, American Pie, Liberal Arts, 21 Jump Street, The Jungle Book etc. Overall, 10/10 for me. \n",
            "\n",
            "573 ) Oh yes, this is the worst prequel and needless to say the worst Star Wars film overall . George Lucas was aiming for the stars with this new take on the saga, however he never even took off and he failed to meet fan expectation for the most part. Amazingly though there are some positives to this film that will always be remembered and rightly so.\n",
            "\n",
            "The first positive of the film are the two main leads of Qui Gon-Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi who are portrayed by Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor respectively. Both of them are really good and memorable for there character interactions and. Neeson and McGregor both bring their game for this film both interns of acting and stunt work which really pays off at the end fight with Darth Maul. It is such a shame that this was the only Star Wars film that Liam Neeson as in because there was great sense of bravery and charm to the character that no one else could pull off. He also had the feeling of the old Obi-Wan Kenobi character from A New Hope which meant that the audience could related to him and have an emotional connection to the character. Also seeing a young Obi- Wan Kenobi for the first time was also really cool and seeing him be the learner instead of the master, was a really interesting angle and cleverly done.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next positive is the pod race which even to this day still looks really cool and shows the revolutionary special effects that were used at that time. It is heart pounding non-stop action from start to finish. So much so that when Anakin and Sebulba come together your not completely sure which one of them will come out on top. The fast paced nature of the editing and accompanied with the great score real works to build a thrilling action scene.\n",
            "\n",
            "Talking of the score of the film that is another positive to this. Unlike The Force Awakens and Rogue One, The Phantom Menace has more memorable score to it. Esecically during the pod racer which is very good and also during the climactic battle between the two Jedi and Maul. That score at the end of the film during the lightsaber battle will go down in Star Wars history, even gives me chills to this today, fantastic.\n",
            "\n",
            "The final positive of the film is the lightsaber battle between Qui Gon-Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi versus Darth Maul, which is and was a huge step up from the original trilogy. If there is one complaint from the original trilogy it is that the lightsaber battles weren't very extravagant and where very controlled, especially in A New Hope. This film fantastically ups the anti with the end duel which is non-stop right from the get go and is truly magical. Great choreography of the fight, fits perfectly with the score and the editing.\n",

Hateful,Irritating,annoying,bad,terrible are just some of the words to describe his performance .\n",

Could of.......No it should have been better, I suppose there is some credit for Lucas trying something different.

Some of the effects have not stood the test of time which is sad and amazing considering that the original trilogy effects do hold up for the most part. Also the droids, what a waste of time, I accepted that the prequels had to try something different from stormtroopers but the droids are not treating in any way. There are just a throw away character from the good guys to kill a lot of.\n",

            "574 ) Oh Christ I've been dreading this, The Phantom Menace is both an insult to the fan-base of Star Wars and to general movie fans in general. To be honest, I don't even know where to begin ... BUT before I start there's maybe two or three things I liked about The Phantom Menace. For a start Ray Park as Darth Maul is one of the most bad ass characters to come out or Star Wars at all, even If he got cut in half way too soon. Also as per usual with Star Wars, John Williams's work in this movie's soundtrack is, awesome. And last and I'm not even sure, If It's least but the fact that Ian McDiarmid was able to come back to the role of Palpatine is a triumph for the series as a whole. Now that all the good parts are talked about, Star Wars Episode I is a bloated CGI mess of George Lucas's mind. And you know what, Jake Lloyd is annoying as little Anakin, the CGI is damn near insulting but ... nothing in this movie is as bad ass Jar Jar Binks, he is literally the worst thing to have ever come out of cinema. Period. And I've seen Battlefield Earth. And to be honest I could spend hours talking about how terrible Binks is but one more thing I have to talk about is the mistreatment of Ewan McGreggor and Liam Neeson in this movie. It's commonly agreed upon that Ewan McGreggor was the best thing about the prequel trilogy but in this movie he's given the worst dialogue and is humiliated whenever he's on screen and as is Liam Neeson who sadly doesn't even get a chance to make up for his character. The supporting cast of this movie puts great actors in all the wrong places, Terrence Stamp is a politician that gets 5 minutes of screen time, Sam Jackson is a quiet diplomat and Brian Blessed ... actually Blessed is a welcome relief as Boss Nass but most surprisingly, the one actor I don't mind in this movie is Natalie Portman playing Padme a.k.a Queen Amidala, she's kind and caring yet she also takes no crap from anyone ... It's just a shame that all fell apart in future movies. But I honestly could go on and on about The Phantom Menace but in short, It's a terrible movie but If you dig really hard, there are some things good about it. \n",
            "\n",
            "575 ) It's kind of hard to review this because I don't see this as one movie, but as a chapter part of one larger story. The reason why I say this is cause George Lucas once said that every Star Wars film are intended to be one big movie split into six parts telling a very complex story. I actually think of this an underrated film cause a lot of people don't listen to what George Lucas has to say of the Star Wars saga is intended to be and how it's to be structured. On it's own, I'd probably rate it as a six or seven out of 10. But as a part of a larger story, it gets a 10 out of 10 cause in the long run, it's the very elements of what happens in the film that really make it matter in the Star Wars saga. If you disagree with me about what I say the structure is, just send me a message or place a comment.\n",

            "I saw The Phantom Menace twice in 3-D. The first time was the day it was released Feb., 10 and the second time was with my sister on the Feb., 20. Overall, I thought the post 3-D conversion was fairly impressive and it was worth seeing it again after nearly 13 years of its original release. Probably the most impressive 3-D shots were with the holograms and some lightsaber fight scenes. You could also see Jar Jar's tongue stick out of the screen in one shot. My eyes did strain a little bit at times with the transition from shots that were dark and kind of dole colored to very bright colored shots. But that's my only problem with the 3-D conversion. It was worth going to see again and recommend to any hard core star wars and general moviegoers. \n",

            "576 ) There are few franchises that have attained the following that George Lucas' brilliant space-opera \"Star Wars\" has earned over it's near forty year history. In many ways, it's gone far beyond what anyone could have imagined and has become a permanent fixture in pop- culture entertainment, practically having transcended the term \"film\" and now become more a devout religion to many. It's a certified and undeniable phenomena with fans the world over. So 1999's release \"Star Wars: Episode I- The Phantom Menace\" was not just a movie... it was an event. A chance to revisit that galaxy far, far away and to explore the seeds that would be sewn to create that original masterpiece of a trilogy that began back in 1977.\n",
            "\n",
            "Unfortunately, we all know how it turned out. While by no means an atrocious film, \"The Phantom Menace\" is a tragically divisive and objectively middling and mediocre continuation of the beloved saga. For every one thing it does right, it does another thing dreadfully wrong. For every major step forward in terms of scope and action, it takes another step back in terms of character and narrative. It's very much a troubled film, peppered with hints of brilliance in between the head-scratching moments of misjudgments and pandering.\n",

            "Set some time before the events of \"A New Hope\", Jedi Knights Qui- Gon Jinn (Liam Neeson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) are sent on a mission to negotiate with the dreaded Trade Federation in an attempt to stop a blockade around the small and peaceful planet of Naboo. However, the negotiations are ended before they begin, and the Jedi Knights are forced to try and protect Naboo's Queen Amidala and her handmaidens including Padme (Natalie Portman) when the Federation invades under order from the evil Darth Sidious. On the way to the Galactic Capital, the Jedi and Queen are forced to land on Tattooine, where they meet young slave Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and take him in after a harrowing series of events. Soon enough, the stage is set for the ultimate battle between Naboo's remaining forces and the Federation's army of robotic minions.\n",

            "The biggest failing of the film is really not what many make it out to be. It's not the contrived and shoehorned comedic spoutings of supporting character Jar Jar Binks (Ahmed Best), nor the questionable acting of the cast or the over-reliance on computer- generated digital effects. Honestly, the biggest problem is the pacing and the subject matter at large. It's a very specific combination of both jarring and boring, with no real sense of internal structure to keep it grounded or moving along at a consistent pace. Early scenes go by in mere moments while later developments stretch on and on with seemingly no end. It's as though George Lucas couldn't find a way to reconcile his desire to create a more heady variation of the franchise while still delivering the thrills and action that fans craved. The result is a mish mash effort that's sometimes frustrating to watch because it feels inorganically built and edited. The subject matter just also clashes so badly with the universe as established in the earlier films. Droning conversations about trade negotiations and shaky politics feel so out of place ad it really bogs the film down. It's far too unfamiliar. Yes, a certain degree of shake-ups are nice to keep a franchise fresh... but it still has to have some consistency.\n",
            "\n",
            "Although I definitely would be lying if I didn't address the other issues that fans commonly complain about as very valid. The dialog is often robotic and forced, leading to characters feeling flat and artificial. The humor is ratcheted up to such a degree that the film borders on the juvenile more than once in an unsettling way. There are many misjudgments in the development taken that seem contrary to what made \"Star Wars\" the series it was. And all too often character development is thrown out the window for non-stop action and bizarrely long dialog exchanges about vague topics like treachery in the Galactic Senate or the villains musing ominously about finally attaining \"revenge.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, there is a bit of fun to be had here, and as I said above, there are hints of a much better movie from time to time. The film presents the biggest scope thus far in the \"Star Wars\" universe, and the visuals and world-building were top-notch for the time. The action was massively thrilling to audiences back in the day and it was great fun finally seeing real Jedi in their prime waging battle against deadly enemies. Even with performances stilted by the wonky dialog, everyone was very well cast and there were a few stand-out roles... particularly McGregor's Obi-Wan, who was cast perfectly. And though it wavered, there was just such a magic to finally returning to this incredible world that Lucas had established so long ago. It might not have been the \"Star Wars\" we wanted... but it was still \"Star Wars.\"\n",
            "\n",
            "As it stands, \"The Phantom Menace\" is still very much the weakest installment of the \"Star Wars\" legacy, though it has just enough of an entertainment factor to make it worth seeing at least once for series fans. It's uneven and shoddily assembled with ill-developed characters and an over-reliance on effects and kid-friendly comedy. But it's action-packed and often thrilling to behold, and it definitely has its moments despite its numerous issues.\n",

I avoided as much of the publicity as I could, only watching the trailer and skipping any magazine articles on the subject. I wanted to enjoy the film and have nothing influencing it. I knew who was in it but that was about it. However it was hard to avoid all the negative information that was spreading. As much as I tried I knew that this film was largely not well liked. This didn't bother me after all it was Star Wars, how bad could it be? I went to the cinema in anticipation and sat down. Then it started.

Jackson, & Ian McDiarmid and up and coming stars Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Ray Park, Dominic West & Keira Knightley. George Lucas has a talent for finding the perfect person for the role. The cast is excellent and make the best of their parts. What George Lucas isn't known for is his script writing. Once again, just like the first Star Wars film it doesn't make much sense at first but this is what all the haters of this film fail to see. This isn't a single film, it is the first of three films. When viewed as a trilogy it all falls into place. There is a reason for everything. Yes, the character of Jar Jar Binks is annoying, but he eventually serves to be the downfall of the galaxy. Many people were too busy hating him and ignoring his appearance in the following films to grasp this. Also yes, Ewan McGregor appears to be terrible in this, but he was meant to be that way. He is playing a character that is still finding his way in the universe and relies on his master for guidance.

            "Let's get the many flaws out of the way: Jar Jar Binks, I swear, the most irritating character ever rendered he is like water torture. At the time, there was an early website entitled Jar Jar Must Die. I concur, he does great damage to the movie. In Lucas' defense, the darkness of Darth Maul, who truly made Dooku look like a girl scout, is why he is trying to balance like he did in Jedi. Also, The wooden acting which reaches the nadir with Shmi. There are good touches here, Neeson's Qui Gon makes you wish they hadn't killed him off so early in the prequels. Watto is an effective character that is well drawn and entertaining. I own this movie for the best light-saber duel found in any Star Wars movie. SPOILER: Fans need to realize how groundbreaking it was for a Jedi to be killed so brutally on film. When I saw this there was a loud gasp, yes, Kenobi was killed in New Hope but he vanished into the Force mystically. Qui Gon is not quite so fortunate, the brutality of the duel with many nasty kicks and punches, interspersed with Obi Wan being thrown off of a landing, please, compare this with any of the duels in the originals? Even the duels in Clones or Sith are nothing on this level for speed and well done fighting. I like the Qui Gon part of the duel but the one between Kenobi and Maul is why I own this. It fills in the legend that was Kenobi, spoken of in New Hope, but when we meet him then he is an old geezer.\n",

Admittedly, it is far from the best Sith, but also commensurately above the,\"I am in pain, please tell me if you are suffering also?\" Yes, Anakin we are in great pain but not from your love for Padme. There is this sense of foreboding about Anakin that is rendered well. My favorite scene is where Shmi is looking at her boy from a distance with a look of fear. The foreshadowing of the monster with the Jedi Council picking up right away there is something quite dangerous about this innocuous looking little boy. Williams' score is the best of the three by a country mile with the classic Duel Of The Fates. The music with the best duel of all six movies, for me, redeems its many deficiencies. Lloyd does a capable job, for one so young, of a sinister little boy with a over-consuming temper, a harbinger of what is to come. What always killed these prequel movies is that we already knew the ending before even viewing the movies. Also, the original had become a thing of cinematic legend that it was impossible to live up to. The casting in the original, besides Ford / Guiness, was not a thing of legend. Ever seen Hamill in other movies? Carrie Fisher? Yes, detractors, Christenson was chosen for his physical resemblance to Vader but his acting was always the weak point of this trilogy.\n",

If you going to buy these, buy Sith first then this one and Clones last. I saw this four times, Clones twice and Sith three times, I won't lie to you, I often got up for popcorn during the Naboo Invasion part. It is not a short duel, Lucas does what he did in Jedi, he has three attacks all going at once. If you want to confirm the direction is bad look at Samuel Jackson, a great actor. Notice how wooden he is here? The original cast complained about Lucas doing one or two takes, it always shows. Yet, for all of its flaws, the movie towers over Clones with an exciting pod race and the best of the light-saber duels. Maul is truly creepy, there is still a move afoot to have him back somehow. Qui Gon's defiance of the Council is always adumbrated as what led to his fatal overconfidence both in his abilities and his brainless faith in Anakin being benign and not malignant. When you watch it over, Lucas has Shmi often glancing with deep worry at Anakin. Yes, fellow critics, wooden acting, Jar Jar and some truly bad casting choices. For all of its failings, I watch this duel over and over. It is simply the most intense, brutal and violent of any of the light-saber battles.

            "582 ) After watching the original three films as a kid, of course I had high expectations for this movie, but even after seeing the movie, and taking into account the faults it had, I still enjoyed the movie and appreciated it. This movie took into account what the original movies lacked. There was more action, which for the most part was great. Also, we finally get to see a closer look at some of the less known planets, some of which we had seen only a glimpse of at the end of \"Return of the Jedi\". There are though a couple a huge problems the movie did have, that would have put off many people who aren't big fans. One of which is how fast paced parts of the movie were, parts of the movie that I would have loved to be longer were cut short, and plenty of amazing areas are not well focused on. Another thing is that Obi-Wan plays only a small role in the movie, acting as more as Qui-Gons side kick, which for any fan would be bothersome. Also Qui-Gon is never really fully explained, and at the end, you kind of end up wishing that he was not put in, or that more was known about him to make the last major fight scene more dramatic. Overall, this movie will get any fan excited, yet annoyed at the same time, and its best just to watch this movie to continue to explore and appreciate the Star Wars Universe. \n",
            "\n",
            "583 ) Honestly I don't get it why so many people hate this movie I can understand it is a bit too long but its not the weakest in the series, the weakest one in the series would have to be episode 2 Attack of the Clones, having too much romance in it. But I think this one is a lot more better then episode 2 in many ways. And also I think Jar Jar Binks is a rather underrated character I know he can be annoying at times but he did play a large role in this film which fans are missing the point. The pod race is problay the best scene in this whole film as it was rather enjoyable to watch over and over again on youtube. Soundtrack is amazing and very well done for this movie. I know some people hate this movie just because of one character but come on give this movie another chance it will surprised you in many ways.\n",

How unfortunate that a movie that came out 39 years ago looks so much better than one that came out 17 years ago. Why did it have to look so colorless and dry? The direction, the camera-work, the editing is impossibly stale and dull. Then there's the acting, which is not very impressive either. And the dialogue? The dialogue of this movie is at the same time unmemorable and cringeworthy. Did Lucas not know how people interact in real life or what?\n",
            "\n",
            "And the pacing, my god the pacing! The movie starts and it spends 30 minutes randomly moving characters from one location to the next. Then the movie completely stops, and for literally 45 minutes we see characters talking and talking. Somewhere in those three quarters we see the pod racing sequence which does look kind of cool, until it drags on for too long. Then 15 minutes of discussions of politics, taxation and trade routes. You know, what we all wanted to see in a Star Wars movie! Finally we have the most complicated ending ever. It spontaneously cuts between four things happening at four different places. The only one of them that's remotely interesting is the lightsaber battle and that's mostly because of the Duel of the Fates song (which is awesome). Then the credits roll and I'm left with a feeling that's a mix of relief, anger and horror.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, \"The Phantom Menace\" is one of the worst films in cinematic history, not just because of it's extremely poor quality in terms of filmmaking, but because of it's impact on us as an audience. In the end, a few good things is drowned in the incoherent stream of utter bulls**t. 3/10. \n",
            "\n",
            "585 ) When I first heard the critics talking about the Star Wars prequels, giving me reasons to not watch them (Jar Jar being the major reason). The only other thing that kept me from seeing this movie was that I had once seen about half of it as a kid and was utterly bored by it. But when I finally saw all the prequels (starting with this one) I found that many of the critics were right in both the good and the bad.\n",
            "\n",
            "This one is about discovering young Anakin, and dealing with politics in a galaxy far far away that make no sense and I care nothing about, because it's Star Wars. I don't want to watch a Star Wars movie where politics makes up about 65% of the movie, which is what happens in Phantom Menace. It bored me as a kid and confuses me as an adult.\n",
            "\n",
            "But alright, if politics is so boring to the kids, how about putting in lots of comedy. That's the movie's problem, it's either too boring or too obnoxious. Boring includes the politics and the uninteresting acting from pretty much all the cast members, except for Jar Jar. Oh man where do I start on what's wrong with this character? 1) He exists only to get a giggle from the kids with all the poop jokes and getting into trouble 2) His voice was interesting for a while, but then it started to get grating 3) He gets into trouble and everybody else into trouble, why does anybody bother to keep him? 4) Lucas described him as the Chewbacca of the prequels, isn't that a laugh? 5) I know everybody says he's a racist stereotype, but I find him too annoying to notice anything racially insensitive, he's that bad.\n",
            "\n",
            "Also, while I like the idea of Anakin being a powerful kid, I seriously wish it was it explored a little more. It was not given enough time, thanks to Jar Jar and politics. If it explored his character a little more I might have become more invested other than just \"Oh he can fix machines\" \"Oh, he bears the Force in his blood\". It might have even made the child actor's performance less bland and monotoned. The kid, while may have done better in other movies, does not work out well here at all. Partly because the writing is so hokey and bad, but also because Lucas didn't try hard enough with him in tone. I believe Liam Neeson's character is alive more than I believe Jake Llyod's because this movie did not give Anakin enough room to breathe.\n",
            "\n",
            "There were other times I questioned what movie I really was watching: Some of the worlds looked a little too modern, like the Jedi planet (forgot the name). It looked much more like a technologically advanced version of New York City. Also, the pod racing has TV announcers. Speaking of which, while the pod racing is cool, I probably would have liked it better if I had not seen Ben Hur with the amazing chariot racing. What also bothers me about it is when you think \"Star Wars\" is pod racing really what comes to mind or is it lightsaber duels? Well thankfully, we do get about twenty minutes worth of a lightsaber fight total in the entire movie. There should have been more honestly, but the best fight scene is Darth Maul vs Obi Wan and Qui Gon. The music accompaniment and the cool choreographed fight still puts me at the edge of my seat, even though I know who's coming out alive. I would have liked to have seen more of Darth Maul, his motivation, where he came from, and see him do more evil under his master's training. We got that from Darth Vader in the original trilogy, why couldn't we see more of Darth Maul? It would be a lot better than sticking around with Jar Jar.\n",
            "\n",
            "For me, the Darth Maul fight sequence was the only thing that felt like a genuine Star Wars moment. The rest was too boring for me to care about, or just too annoying. The acting was dull, there was too much politics, too much Jar Jar, and I still wonder how nobody figures out that Palpatine's the Sith Lord. I'm glad some people like it, but personally, this movie is anything but a legit Star Wars Movie. \n",

            "586 ) This film, released more than ten years after the last film in the original trilogy, marks the start of the second Star Wars trilogy, a prequel to the original movies. It may even be considered that, if the first trilogy was the story of Luke Skywalker, the second is the story of Darth Vader. In this film, directed and written by George Lucas, has the participation of Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, Ian McDiarmid, among other actors.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is a film that seeks to begin a new trilogy but that's full of failures, with a single guilty: George Lucas. He made the script and the direction, but he seems so concerned about action and special effects that forgot everything else. The script is reasonable, the connection he makes with the previous films, although remote, is credible. However, it gives too much importance to things that don't matter (as the race where Anakin participates) and ignore events that, if they had been developed, would have made the film more interesting. This is the case of the Naboo's invasion, which should have been more dramatic, and Luke chose to observe coolly, from the Amidala's palace windows. Another flaw is the character's design. Lucas took all the emotional and psychological side, emptying them. There are even certain characters that shouldn't exist because they have no relevance, as Sebulba, a poor attempt to create a villain which is never threatening. The passion of Amidala and Anakin, who should have been intense and overwhelming, hardly goes beyond the exchange of glances, prudish and restrained, unable to move the audience. Its a film with plenty of action, but a huge emotional shyness, unable to make the audience shed a tear. The public sees and appreciates, but isn't attached to the characters. The most notable exception is Jar Jar, a humorous and well developed character, making the audience love him or hate him and leaving anyone indifferent. So, if by some chance the actors didn't seem to be particularly inspired in this film, we can blame Luke, as the actors did what was asked of them.\n",
            "\n",
            "Action scenes and special effects deserve applause and are, truly, the great strong point of the film. The new technologies have enabled to make wonders apparently unbelievable at the time of the first film. The costumes, characterization and scenarios also deserve congratulations. The soundtrack wasn't particularly great but the editing and sound effects were at the highest level, leading to the Oscar nomination for Best Sound, Best Sound Effects and Best Visual Effects. \n",

            "587 ) Phantom Menace was the best i love the prequels... Disney wishes they could make movies like George Lucas it had such originality and so many ideas. All the characters chosen couldn't be chosen better. It made sense to the rest of the movies. Jar Jar was an amazing character i cant believe so many people dislike this character. The scenes were beautiful the story line was amazing. People should appreciate the Prequels more and appreciate George Lucas for these amazing movies. People said it was all cgi special effects but it was all real places real scenery they really need to get informed better. People who hate on it just didn't want to see something new about Star wars all they wanted was something like the old parts. For me number 1 2 and 3 were way better than 4 5 and 6. \n",

Although you don't need this film to finish the rest of the saga, likable characters and amazing saber fights with dips and dives not imagined will have you wanting to see more. Arguably the best of the prequels of the amazing adventure of a series. Watch this movie without adding it to the rest of the movies to get the best feel and an amazing standalone film. Don'fall into the bandwagon of hating this movie! I loved it as you will too. Of you liked any of the Star Wars movies, you'll understand how good this film really is. \n",

            "\n",
            "3) Jake Lloyd may have been young, but choose a better actor. For the love of the Force, I would have even preferred a young Hayden Christiansen.\n",
            "\n",
            "4) Jar-Jar. For the love of God, please no. This would have been acceptable under two possible circumstances. 1, he just wasn't there. or 2, the Jar-Jar Sith lord theory holds true, which would have in fact, made this move by George really creative. \n",
            "\n",
            "590 ) I know I'm more than likely in the minority with this, but I like this movie a lot. I know it has it's problems but it still holds a special place in my heart. If you look at this movie from the perspective of it being the very first entry in the series (with nothing else to go off of) it sets the stage very well for the other 5 films. It may have it's ridiculous moments, like Anakin's autopilot conveniently taking him where he needs to go, and the conflict isn't as strong as other entries, but I can look past those things. I know this movie has gotten a lot of flack from supposed Star Wars fans, but I wonder how many of them actually saw it. I feel like all the hate for this stems not from people seeing it, but rather people watching \"die-hard fans\" dissect the movie and all of it's faults. These people then take others opinions as their own, and spread the hatred for this movie blindly. I have no evidence to back this up, that's just what I feel. Also, I don't find Jar Jar Binks annoying. I think the amount of hate people have for him is just them trying to find more faults with the film. And yes, Jake Lloyd isn't the best child actor, but I can't name many child actors that are Oscar worthy, can you? He didn't deserve to be harassed and given death threats by \"die-hard fans\". In conclusion, is this the best Star Wars movie? No. Do I think it's a good enough start to one of my favorite franchises of all time? Yes. If you haven't already, give this film a try with an open mind, you just might like it. Or you can watch angry fanboys with way too much time on their hands completely destroy the movie in videos that are 2 hours long. I'm sorry, but anyone that takes that much time to talk about how much they hate something, needs to get a life.\n",

I think this movie is very hated and very bashed from critics and fans. In my opinion I love it, I think it is miles way better flick than The Force Awakens! The Phantom Menace didn't kill Han Solo (in such a awful way) or rip off A New Hope beat. The Phantom Menace has a cooler villain in Darth Maul (and a cooler weapon. And at LEAST Phantom Menace has some new music that was worth Duel of the Fates. Like I said I love Liam Neeson as Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn and Ewan McGregor as his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi in this flick. I think the actors did a wonderful job, the way George Lucas imagine to do it. I love Queen Amidala/Padme with all that make up and the costume that was created for her. Natalie Portman did an excellent job portraying her character, she is very sexy talented and extremely gorgeous in here. I remember in 1999 when they were talking about filming this film, I still have news papers clips saved in my drawer when they where filming this film.

It still is a Star Wars film at heart - the view's just mucked up by a few things, that's all. The experience itself I would rate a 7. I was perhaps fortunate to view the films several years after its release, and frankly, I was not expecting much from this movie. It exceeds expectations, definitely.

Fine. Okay. Which, naturally, explains why Episode I charts the rise of the fearsome Empire we've already seen ravage the galaxy through... federation disputes about trade embargoes and senatorial hearings. Not that you can fault Lucas for supplanting his sci-fi with sociopolitical subtext, but his writing - wooden, but endearingly so in '77 - has only eroded through the years, and simply isn't up to the challenge. So, the ongoing scenes of half-baked political murmurings too boring for kids and adults alike are counterbalanced with an inexcusable deluge of unbearable slapstick and excruciating racist alien stereotypes (mesa not sawwy, Jar Jar) that would have felt agonizingly antiquated during the first round of Star Wars.

Lucas' pacing and story may be shoddy, stumbling from thinly strung together plot points with none of the breathlessly efficient urgency of A New Hope, but he's cunning about knowing how to poke the nostalgia buttons when needed. There's an insuppressible glee that comes from getting to say hello again to the most familiar of faces - Yoda, R2-D2, C-3PO, Jabba the Hutt, or hearing the phrase \"Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet Anakin Skywalker\" - no matter how forced their inclusions. Episode I also benefits from Lucas' attention to world-building, with many visual panoramas dazzling here before his love affair with CGI led to the cluttered visual noise of Episodes II and III. It's also fun as a creature feature caper, and the underwater world of the Gungans and subsequent aquatic behemoth chase are still stellar entertainment, as is the infamous pod racing sequence (even though, yes, it's stupidly motivated, and too drawn out, caveat caveat). And yes, neutering the mystical, open-to-interpretation spirituality of the Force with the buzzkill of midi-chlorians is, in the words of (sigh) Jar Jar Binks, \"How wude!\" - but even this isn't as theologically lugubrious (a word I had to seek out to properly do justice to this odious instance) as Anakin's 'immaculate Force conception'. Yeah. Forgot about that garbage, didn't ya.\n",

In fact, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan effortlessly deflecting blaster shots back to the shooters is so awesome that even Lucas can't get enough of it, pitting the Jedi against swathes of useless, irritating droids, and incepting the consequence-and-largely-thrill-free 'CGI blob' fights that would grow to increasingly infect the next decade of blockbuster cinema like a sickness. But come on - Dual of the Fates? Indisputably one of the best sword fights of any kind in movie history, right down to the interlude of Qui-Gon meditating behind a force field wall midway through. But if there's one single 'Chosen One' to rescue Episode I from purgatory, it's John Williams. Unscathed by the creative compromises surrounding him, and abetted by the phenomenal whirrs and bleeps of Ben Burtt's unmatched sound design, Williams delivers 300%, crafting some of his best musical movie magic here. If the film feels at all like Star Wars, you have Williams to thank, not Lucas.\n",

So, naturally, Lucas kills them both off, to make more room for Jake Lloyd, one of the most detestably monotone, whiny child actors of all time... who is supplanted by one of the most detestably monotone, whiny adult actors of all time in II and III. Thankfully, Ewan McGregor gives his most charismatic Alec Guinness impression, battling gamely with Lucas' atrocious dialogue and tendency to bench Obi-Wan for long stretches of film, and Natalie Portman's Amidala is delightfully plucky here (and don't forget to play 'spot the Keira Knightley when they're in makeup!), before being wasted in an embarrassing, mopey Twilight subplot in the following two. Ian McDiarmid lurks and sleazes delightfully as the least secret Sith lord ever, and Samuel L.

It is the fourth film in George Lucas' Star Warrs franchise and the first chronologically. The cast includes quite a couple famous names: Natalie Portman, Liam Neeson, Keira Knightley, Terence Stamp, Ewan McGregor and others and they all (more or less) shine in their roles. Unfortunately, one of the major characters is played by a child actor named Jake Lloyd, who was pretty unbearable. It was so obvious how he tried so hard to be on par with all these more experienced actors and he failed miserably. The sad thing is that, despite his age, he was not new to the industry at all, had played with other stars before, so he should really know that sometimes subtlety is the key. Instead, he went full ham for most of his performance and I blame him that this has not become a better film, but also writer-director George Lucas that he did not cast a more talented kid and that he did not tell Lloyd to lay low.\n",

Jar Jar Binks was the major non-human character in here and he was included solely for comedic purpose, but it was all pretty embarrassing. Maybe they should have kept him from being able to speak in the tradition of the old non-human characters. Still, there are a couple good moments in terms of the story too.

Neeson and Portman brought some nice depth to their characters. McGregor was fairly forgettable unfortunately. I recommend checking this one out. It is not considerably better or worse than the old films or the new one. Then again, I am not the greatest sci-fi buff and certainly not a major Star wars fan in general, so the best may be if you decide for yourself and check this one out. I recommend it.

I decided to watch all three prequels again (and hopefully for the last time) in order to get a fresh perspective on them.

The major aspect I find The Phantom Menace does has going for it over the other two prequels are the aesthetics. It comes the closet to resembling the original trilogy, if still incredibly far off. The Phantom Menace was shot on film and does feature on location filming and even some practical effects here and there, so the whole thing doesn't come of looking like a video game as Episodes II and III did. There is a lot of eye candy to behold, such as the locations such as the Palace of Caserta in Italy (why do you want to film everything on a green screen when beautiful places like this exist in the world?), while the costume design - not something I would normally comment on - is very pleasing to the eyes. The only two scenes in The Phantom Menace which has a little bit of that excitement that I get watching the original trilogy are the pod race and final lightsaber duel between Obi-Wan, Qui-Gon and Darth Maul; an impressive display of acrobatics and is it's not choreographed within an inch of its life like the duels in Episodes II and III.

Watching the film again I expected to have reactions of \"yeah it sucks, what else is new\", but sitting down and watching the entire thing my brain became so numb from the never ending monotone exposition. I'm not even that keen on the John Williams score; it's not bad by any means - far from it - but it feels too dark and moody for a Star Wars movie. As fine a piece of music as Duel of the Fates is, those booming choirs feel out of place for Star Wars. In regards to the most hated fictional character of all time, I don't think Jar Jar is the absolute worst thing ever, I can at least tolerate him (if there's any character in the prequel trilogy that bothers me for how ridiculous they are: its General Grievous).

Perhaps it's own such a direction could have worked if you know, the execution wasn't total pants. I can see what Lucas was perhaps going for in the story in trying to portray the fall of a democracy; the idea of radicals using political unrest as a means of coming to power - such as the Nazis using the turmoil caused by the great depression to amass power. Perhaps the empire isn't such a bad thing, it appears under their command the universe became a more interesting place. As someone who is interested in the relationship people have with popular culture, I find the most interesting aspect of The Phantom Menace is nothing in the film itself but rather its place in history. Think about it, the most anticipated movie of all time and it was a colossal let down, and this occurring during the early days of the internet. What would the world of geekdom be like if The Phantom Menace actually lived up to expectations? Would an entire generation be less cynical?

            "While The Phantom Menace does deliver some entertaining moments, updated visuals, and astonishing new soundtrack by the great composer John Williams; Episode I as a Star Wars movie, just lacks the dynamism of Episode IV, the depth of Episode V, and the character development of episode VI. When a prequel to a great trilogy is being planned, two thoughts could easily cross anyone's mind: you either play it safe so as to keep the reputation of the fore mentioned original movies, or play it bold so as to deliver a whole new experience and add value to the franchise. The problem is, episode I does neither. It's a movie that is mostly filler almost entirely brought to life by computer-generated-imagery, which, as opposed to the now memorable and iconic practical effects from the original trilogy, as a CGI based film ages, it becomes outdated and obsolete rather than classic. Late 90's visual effects such as seen on this movie, just lack the character, the creativeness, the fun, and the attention to detail we were used to in the original trilogy's amazing physical scenarios, costumes, and hand crafted scale models.\n",
            "\n",
            "The characters seen in this movie are mostly OK, nothing that special whatsoever besides those already introduced in previous movies, but overall they're what some may call \"semi-decent\". That is, for the most part. Huge exceptions will be mentioned further.\n",

The dynamics and relationship between these two characters throughout the movie seem acceptable, Liam Neeson's acting as Qui Gonn is in my opinion very good, he is wise and patient yet powerful, he doesn't follow the code to the letter and mildly challenges the Council which add a nice \"don't always play by the rules\" touch to the character. Ewan McGregor as Obi Wan, is also well done. He is reckless, impatient, but obedient and loyal to his master, he is young and energetic. Everything a Jedi apprentice should be. Let's continue with the main villain, the Sith Lord Darth Maul.\n",

Leaving the spectator with enormously unfulfilled expectations, especially if we bear in mind the villain we all loved from the original trilogy, Darth Vader. We don't know where Maul comes from, why is he evil, what motivates him. We don't know absolutely nothing about this character. Hence delivering a generic, dull villain to which none could sympathize to, due to almost nonexistent character development. Then there is this goofy, silly, and obvious comic-relief CGI alien, which brings close to nothing to the film. Jar Jar Binks. He is unnecessarily and forcefully made \"essential to the plot\", though he is objectively an unbearable character which could easily be replaced. One is forced to endure this absurd and less than mediocre excuse of a Star Wars creation throughout most of the movie's screen time. Expendable, stupid: Enter Jar Jar Binks.\n",

The phantom menace could and should have been nothing more than a trailer to its sequels Episode II and III. An introduction, an epilogue at the most. Almost everything we love about the Star Wars universe is barely touched or bypassed, and everything we hate seems recurrent, constantly forced into the viewer's mind. i.e. the trade federation is over-explained, so is the bureaucracy in the senate, and even the Force. Yes, the awesome concept of energy that \"surrounds us, and binds us\" was degraded and mocked, by trying to explain it with \"midi-chlorians\". An intelligent microscopic life-form, which, with the proper concentration, gives its living host, the power to become a Jedi. The mysticism and depth associated with the Force in episode V was destroyed to become an arbitrary concentration of a microscopic \"sort-of-thing\" on a random boy on a random planet, randomly found by Qui Gonn Jin.

Why did Obi Wan say Owen didn't want Luke to follow him as Anakin had? Anakin didn't follow Obi-Wan and Owen hardly knew his (step) brother. Furthermore, we are somewhat acceptably introduced to R2D2, C3PO appears as well and we're told it was actually built by Anakin Skywalker a.k.a Darth Vader, both needless \"links\", which just raise more questions such as: how did Obi Wan didn't recognize both of the droids when they meet again further in episode IV?

            "Star Wars (1977) was originally intended for children. So was The Empire Strikes Back (1980) as well as The Return Of The Jedi (1983). And the younger audience ended up being the biggest fans of the films. But 16 years later, a kids movie marketed for kids was bashed and hated by the same audience. Why? Because they were 16 years older. No longer kids. They watched the film with adult eyes that had grown accustomed to sci-fi blockbusters that came in Star Wars' wake. Films like the first two Terminator films, Independence Day (1996) and The Fifth Element (1997). Of course there was no way adults could enjoy \"Menace\" when it was compared to these films. It was made for their kids. The children of 1999 of course loved the film as they should have. Step back and look at the film from a child's perspective and you quickly understand that Jar Jar Binks isn't there to please the adults. Jake Lloyd as Anakin isn't there to please the adults. The Podrace isn't there to please the adults. If you take a step back and get some new perspective you see that this is the first chapter of a story. Those who say this film is unnecessary to the Star Wars saga will see that this film is the exposition and the introduction of characters. It's not gonna be as exciting as a film set right in the middle of a war. You need a few boring trade disputes to trigger the much more intriguing downfall of a republic and rebellion against an empire. Yet few can argue that this episode contains one of, if not the best lightsaber duels in the entire series. And like every episode before it, it pushed the boundaries of special effects. Long before we ever saw an army of Uruk hai storm the gates if Helm's Deep, an army of Gungans defending their home from and army of thousands of battle droids.\n",

            "I could go on and on, because I'm a nerd who cares about these things for some reason. But Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace IS a great Star Wars movie. Not a great movie. A great Star Wars movie. George Lucas created a series of film that exist apart form the rest of cinema. They are so different, they can only be compared to each other and be judged by the episodes that came before it. Adults will watch this film with critical eyes towards dialogue and character development and other \"movie measurements.\" If you wanted my review of Episode I as just a basic movie, it would be much poorer. But as the brilliant Roger Ebert observed: \"I prefer to evaluate a film on the basis of what it intends to do, not on what I think it should have done.\" The Star Wars movies intend to capture the imagination of children and the child-like spirit of adults. And by that criteria, Episode I succeeds as much as IV, V, and VI. So if you've already seen The Phantom Menace, give it another look. If you haven't seen it, watch it with a child's eyes. George Lucas' true vision for his saga will come through. Perspective is everything. \n",

            "605 ) I believe \"Every Saga Has A Beginning\" was the tag line for this installment of the Star Wars saga. In those five words you expect one of the greatest feats in motion picture history to be displayed before you, the very start of Star Wars? Wow! After 16 since Return of the Jedi, a solid addition to the saga, much like it's original two predecessors, what else would you be expecting? The original trilogy was amazing in every sense of the word, so how did George Lucas, the one who created it all, manage to demolish it's beginning? Well for starters, I think that this movie and it's following two sequels aren't bad, and I don't hate them like most, I just find them to be Marjory disappointing. Firstly The Phantom Menace was over-hyped to the point of absurdity, and add nostalgia from original trilogy fans, watching this mess is understandably painful for them. It is regarded the greatest let down in cinema, and rightfully so. This movie does so much things wrong, not just from the regular missteps movies suffer from, but it's overall feel and failure to emotionally connect with its disappointed audience. Speaking of story wise, if this is the prequel to the original trilogy, why are there so many glaring plot errors? Why didn't Yoda train Obi-Wan, let alone Anakin, who the hell is the Emporer and why is he evil, for everything this movie did wrong, The Force Awakens did right. Utilising actors, making memorable characters, great story line, great acting, action with substance etc... Why is Obi Wan so obedient, he should be adventurous like Luke! The opening crawl sets the audience up for a bleak adventure, which is missing the fun and enjoyment of the originals. Jake Lloyd is terrible as Anakin SKYWALKER, and even though he's a kid, if you're a good director you can make an even better actor, Lucas is too lenient, and is instead too concerned about special effects, which is where the movie shines. But what's a special effect without a story? It's not to say there's some cool moments in this film, not to mention cool additions to the overall universe. When Obi Wan and Qui Gon battle the droids for the first time is genuinely entertaining, Darth Maul is really cool, I don't care that he didn't really have a back-story, the pod race is awesome, the final duel is great though again doesn't compare to the raw and gritty duel in Empire, and that's about it. So many errors were made in this movie, it's hard to keep track, but for whatever reason, I still enjoy the Phantom Menace, and always will... As a kid I didn't know much about the story errors and other problems, and enjoyed it as much as the originals, and that tiny part of me remains. Sure it's got Jar Jar Binks, whose existence in the entirety of the movie is questionable, sure Samuel L. Jackson and Ewan McGregor and Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman are dangerously under-utilized, but it's a clunky movie. George Lucas didn't know what he actually created, and thusly destroyed a piece of it. The movie had too many subplots and is overall incomparable to any of the original trilogy, while some characters may seem cool, they aren't fleshed out enough to care about, while others aren't fleshed out at all (NUTE GUNRAY). George Lucas had sixteen years to create the beginning of Star Wars, and in all that time this is what we got! The only reason I can't hate this movie is because it's Star Wars, and still remains enjoyable, adding cool moments to the saga, thusly I name this review the Phantom Disappointment.... \n",
            "\n",
            "606 ) Making a comparison between the first film of the original trilogy of \"Star Wars\" and the first one of the prequels is just heartbreaking. Where there was fun and wit, there are dumb, flat, B-comedy jokes. Where there were fantastic characters there are weak, poor and sometimes irritating characterizations that make you hate the new ones and even the old ones in their new guise. \"Star Wars: The Phantom Menace\" is easily the most disappointing film ever, considering the hype and hope that everybody had at the time to see something that could stand between the originals. I usually say that the prequels can't be canon, they must be considered a fan fiction that someone started as a kid (Episode I), then continued as a frustrated emo teenager (Episode II) and ended as a disillusioned adult (Episode III). Jokes aside -if that is to be considered a joke-, it's very hard for a fan to not get angry at all this mess. Story-wise, the introduction of a scientific reason behind the Force is a gigantic mistake, as it takes away all of the magic aura the concept was surrounded by. Character-wise, Ana-kid is unbearable and his final act is so random you'd hope you never saw it, while the others are barely easier to sympathize with, also thanks to some of the most wooden performances by otherwise good actors. The baddies in this one are most significantly represented by the honestly good looking Darth Maul, but his haunting looks are not supported by an adequate personality, which is as thin as paper. Even the music is not as good as before, consolidating my idea that John Williams perfectly molds his soundtracks on the movie, for better or for worse. Let's take a breath, though, and evaluate the silver linings. The massive CGI use is still impressive, with a number of strange and imaginative creatures and vehicles (in the best Star Wars tradition), with kinda-exciting scenes where characters shut up and let the computer graphics entertain. And, fortunately, they do. So, although I hate when that happens, special effects and a little imagination on Lucas's side help the otherwise messed up movie.\n",

            "One thing most people at least agree with is the fact that the Prequel's story, including Episode I's, is quite a bit more complex than the story of the original films. While many claims say it turned out unsuccessfully complex, I can't agree. For its insane focus on so-called wooden dialogue\", it's perplexingly sad how the achievements of Episode I's screenplay are publicly missed, forgotten or lightly dismissed. It's as overlooked as it is to be appreciated how George Lucas managed to write a script that introduced a lot of overarching themes and developments while still telling a very basic and immediate story of people fighting for freedom. After all, there are five corresponding story lines depicted in Episode I (Palpatine's rise, the Invasion and Liberation of Naboo, the Jedi's mission introducing the galaxy's workings, the return of the Sith, the discovery of a young boy).\n",

You kind of wonder why this or that character is there until at some point of the film it becomes obvious.\n",
            "\n",
            "The films main story is certainly driven by the character of Qui-Gon Jinn, who leads us through the events and gives audiences an anchor for orientation. Despite some contrary claims, this did not go on the expense of Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-Wan, after all, was allowed to grow in the wind shadow of his master. In their end fight, Obi-Wan is neither as aggressive as Maul nor as calm and Qui-Gon Jinn and when his master is killed, he almost fails by giving in to his anger and thoughts of revenge. Ultimately though, he remembered his master's teaching which allows him to defeat and kill Darth Maul with Jinn's weapon and become a Jedi Knight.\n",
            "\n",
            "While Qui-Gon is obviously the main driving force of the story, the story itself revolves around a young Queen who is challenged with the struggle of being peaceful and passive or going into a fight to help themselves. In her journey to find the right answer, she meets Anakin Skywalker. Looking at The Phantom Menace with the knowledge of the following two movies, it's remarkable how fluent the groundwork for Anakin's character played out. Anakin's birth into slavery and the following strong need to be free of orders, independent of authority were obvious in both Episode II and III for one. The boy's relationship with both his mother, Shmi (finally introducing the mother), and his surrogate father, Qui-Gon Jinn, is the other side and the emotional heart of the movie. The sense of family that they convey gives a maturity to the series that has been absent before. As part of that, we get to see how Anakin is deeply skilled and gifted while at the same time being confronted with the roots of his fall. Contrary to other Jedi, Anakin has been grown up with his mother and he has become attached to her. Leaving her was a big challenge and the ultimate fate of Shmi (her death with him being unable to stop it) would greatly affect Anakin's action when again confronted with the need to let go (of Padme) to a great extent.\n",

            "Ironically, little Anakin has become almost as hated on the internet as Jar Jar Binks. His reception in nerd culture is sad, not least because Jar Jar is a characters that's supposed to teach us to respect every being because every being has its worth - even if it's sometimes annoying to reach that potential and worth. Jar Jar unconsciously made the first step to bond the Naboo and the Gungans and those who believed in him, particularly Queen Amidala and Qui-Gon Jinn, were rewarded for their faith and humanity. So after being somehow irritating for more than half of the film, Jar Jar becomes important and that's characteristic for the movie. You get to see its full potential and the value that it brings to the Star Wars legend once you allow yourself to let the movie unfold in its own way.\n",

The many wide shots showing characters in the context of their environment and the situation the go through just as much call for attention as precise and haunting close-ups of characters like Amidala.

He is so annoying you want him to die the instant he opens his mouth. Instead he leads the Jedi to the next offensive racial stereotype in the form of Boss Nass. Several supposedly \"exciting\" minutes later we are introduced to wooden Natalie Portman. Why does everyone think she is a good actress. I never thought she was good in anything before this or since.\n",
            "\n",
            "Long, long time after this we are introduce to Jake Lloyd as young Vader. I can't believe he got this part. Watch the making off documentary. They turn down 2 kids who obviously have better acting skills. (We also meet yet another stereotype in the form of Watto.) So we have a long boring pod race with mind numbing commentary from a weird alien creature, before it's off to talk politics for an hour while the Jedis' and the Queen's story of invasion is not believed by the Senate. (They trust the Jedi to negotiate peace, but don't trust them about the invasion?)\n",

            "Finally, we return to Naboo and Darth Maul makes his appearance to the Jedi and we are given the only truly thrilling part of the movie with the amazing lightsaber duel, only to have it ruined by something that happens two movies later. (See my review on Revenge of the Sith.)\n",

            "You might still be able to defend this movie in your mind, but I have to ask, \"Who is the main Character?\" There isn't one. And name me one likable protagonist in the film. You can't do it. When these movies came out, I convinced myself I liked them too. (I'll tell you how I found out I hated these movies in my review of Revenge of the Sith.) Really think about it.

Sure, it can be a bit sloppy at times, and it switches from plot a to plot b constantly.The stereotypes can be jarring at times. But you know what, it is still brilliant. The characters are likable. Even jar jar is not that bad. The acting is OK. Not great, but OK. The hate seems to stem from old trilogy fans, not knowing that this film was merely trying to be something different. Yes, if you want a film that feels like the old trilogy, this is not for you. But if you are looking for a fast-paced, lighthearted sci-fi action movie with one or two smart scenes, good scenery, and interesting alien designs, then this is for you. \n",

Jar Jar Binks is absolutely one of the most dumbest characters in movie history there were 2 scenes that he could die easily and he didn't why? why George Lucas? Instead they killed Liam Neeson who by the way was a pretty good character and Darth Maul was a great villain too bad he was cut in half. The acting isn't something special, the cgi is not that great and the script/direction not that good either some actors don't even want to be here like Keira Knightley. The humor was another big issue for me because it was mostly from Jar Jar who killed his enemies by accident most of the time. I was around a 7.5 but i give it an 8 because of the Obi Wan & Qui Gon Jinn v.s Darth Maul battle that was one of the best scenes from the movie by far. \n",

Now you may say \"Well he's a child actor so it can be excused\" but I've seen a fair amount of good child actors in my day and this certainly isn't one. I understand if the kids aren't important to the movie then sure, get some actors who don't know the first thing about it because they're not important. But when they're pretty much the main character then you have to try a little harder. Lloyd's performance was quite bad, which made his character end up feeling more fake. He wasn't the only bad actor though, a lot of other secondary characters weren't so talented either.\n",
            "\n",
            "The writing isn't the best. Some of the lines the actors were given were pretty cheesy or stupid, and made the characters just appear goofy or unrealistic.\n",

            "The special effects are pretty bad sometimes. At some points it looks fine because everything else is CGI too so it all just blends together, but when you put CGI Jar Jar Binks next to real Liam Neeson it really stands out as clearly fake, which would obviously take you out of the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "A lot of the time I found myself wondering 'why?' throughout the movie. Why is that there? Why would you do that? Some things just didn't make sense. I could think of absolutely no reason why it exists, so why does it? What purpose could a row of red laser doors that automatically open for two seconds before closing for thirty seconds possibly serve? I don't know, but it really bothered me sometimes.\n",

            "622 ) As much as I really, really like \"Star Wars\" and the entire universe and franchise, then it is really a difficult pill to swallow this first prequel. And yes, it is primarily because of the clown character Jar Jar Binks. He was just too much all of the time.\n",
            "\n",
            "But I also found the entire pod race scene to be too much. Yes, visually it was impressive, but it was just a filler for the storyline. A filler that took up way too much time from the movie. And that whole wonder boy thing with Anakin just wore thin really, really fast.\n",

            "623 ) One thing we're all hearing on the news right now, is how a new Star Wars film is coming out. There is a lot of hype and excitement. I was wondering if there'd be anymore Star Wars after Episode 3. I even remember talking with friends back in 1999 about Lucas planning episodes 7-9. Right now, it's only to 7. When Episode 1 came out we were anticipating sequels every 3-years. So, after a 10-year hiatus another Star Wars movie is coming out, which has brought lots of excitement especially to the Star Wars fans. More excitement than when episodes 2 and 3 came out as those were anticipated movies only 3-years apart.\n",
            "\n",
            "Seeing all this excitement reminds me of when Star Wars Episode 1 was coming out. I'm old enough to remember back then. I seriously can't believe how long ago that time was. Back then in 1999, YouTube wasn't a website and it was harder to stream videos on the internet. There also wasn't really social media, not like today. Back then as you can see on the IMDb trivia, and I even remember my friend telling me this at the time when he was only 10. There were a lot of people who would pay a full-price for a movie just to see the Star Wars movie trailer, and they wouldn't even stay for the movie. They'd just leave after the trailer for Episode 1 was shown. It was exciting back then to think after a 16-year hiatus and starting with the later episodes, they'd start from episode 1, the beginning of the story.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'll tell you now, if you watch the Star Wars films in chronological order, I'm sure you'll notice they don't seem canon. Episode 1-3 we'll see canon as their trilogy along with episodes 4-6. But, the trilogies will barely seem to go together. This new film also looks more canon to episodes 4-6 considering we see Harrison Ford in it, and it looks like the Star Wars action we're familiar with. The earlier episodes of Star Wars seem newer than episodes 4-6 with higher quality special effects and where the actors in the earlier films seem like they're from the '70s-'80s as opposed to today. Also, how there are vague references to the earlier story from the later episodes, as I believe Lucas was still coming up with it.\n",
            "\n",
            "In other words of watching the series in chronological order, it's not like Dragon Ball Z as fans of the show know that they started with DragonBall Z in the U.S. and people are probably less familiar with DragonBall. But, DragonBall was the earlier and original series and if you watch the earlier episodes of DragonBall, it will seem more canon to DragonBall Z than the earlier episodes of Star Wars will seem canon to the Star Wars series. Now that I'm talking about DragonBall Z, I'll mention that I think D.B.Z. is a better story than Star Wars.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, what makes this 1st episode great. So, yeah there was lots of excitement for episode 1 but a lot of people are giving this movie bad reviews including here on IMDb. I have to give it a positive review, here's why? It seems like a lot of the negative reviews were because of people who disliked Jar Jar Binks, or didn't like Anakin Skywalker as a kid, and how the actor who played him has long since quit acting. Some of us think there should have been a different child actor for his part. You could look at the auditions. Even during this episode, we knew who Anakin would become as it wasn't meant to be a surprise. It seems like the actor who played Qui Gon Jin didn't like playing his part either.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, what I like about this first Star Wars film is out of all of them it seems like the most innocent. I guess it's pretty innocent showing a child as a main character and a hero for the series. That being said, this movie would definitely work for younger kids, probably more than the other films as it can almost seem like the plot was written by a kid. But, not like it was poorly written. Though, some people disagree with the writing of the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "As my title says, I also feel like this film is the fastest paced one in the series. It's been awhile since I've seen a Star Wars movie and the later ones. Star Wars is a good story with good action, but I feel like a lot of them have so many Go Pee moments. Long movies that have a lot of slow scenes, and episode 3 can be a little depressing. This first movie seems like the happiest in the series.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another fun memorable scene from this movie which would also make me consider it the best one is the Pod Racing scene. The other Star Wars movies seem to focus on the story and action. The Pod Racing scene was just a really well done fun scene making us see Anakin's young abilities. I thought I heard there was a video game called Pod Racing made a long time, but I haven't heard about it in such a long time.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also feel like this Star Wars movie would be the easiest to understand. So, while I'm not a big fan of Star Wars, I have to rank this one as the best. I know this displeases some of you who dislike this movie. But, I think it was well done and is the most fun. I give it a 9/10. \n",
            "\n",
            "624 ) Watched my favorite Movie of All time Star Wars:The Phantom Menace which in My opinion is not only the greatest Sci-Fi Movie of All Time But also The Greatest Movie of All time. The Cast Was Stellar With Ewan McGregor(Trainspotting) as Obi-Wan Kenobi, Liam Neeson(Schindlers List) as Qui-Gon Jinn , the lovely Natalie Portman(Leon The Professional) as Padme Amidala, ,Jake Llyod(Jingle All The Way) as Young Anakin Skywalker,Ahmed Best(Instant Zoom) as Jar Jar Binks,Samuel L. Jackson(Pulp Fiction) as Mace Windu ,Ray Park(Mortal Kombat:Annilation) as Darth Maul , Brian Blessed(One We Were Warriors) as Boss Nass, Silas Carson(Fever Pitch) as Nute Gunray/Ki-Adi-Mundi, Andy Secombe(Peak Practice) as Watto, Pernilla August(Gossip) as Shmi Skywalker, Keira Knightley(Bend It Like Beckham) as Sabe ,Frank Oz(The Muppet Movie) as Master Yoda and Ian McDarimid(Sleepy Hallow) as Chancellor Palpatine/Darth Sidious. The The Film is the best out o the Star Wars Saga with The High Octane Political Underpinnings with a brilliant Story and fantastic visuals and the best Lightsaber fight Between Obi- Wan Kenobi, Qui- Gon Jinn & Darth Maul in The Epic Duel Of Fates , Amazing Cinematography By David Tattersall(The Green Mile),Production Design By Gavin Bocquet(Kafka) and Special Effects By Dennis Muren(T2 Judgement Day) ,Amazing Direction from The King of Star Wars Himself George Lucas(American Graffiti ), Fantastic Costume design from Trisha Biggar(Young Indiana Jones ) and Amazing Score from John Williams(Jurassic Park) definitely one of my favorite movies ever 10/10 \n",
            "\n",
            "625 ) All the stupid movie goers and Star Wars fanboys couldn't get what the film was about.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was about Jar Jar Binks, the phantom menace. A gungan from Naboo with a troubled childhood, who was later trained in the use of the force, more accurately the dark side. He was a sith long before episode 1 and he manipulated everyone around him. He uses force jumps, mind control, martial arts. He was and maybe he is still the true Sith Lord, but thanks to the neckbeards whining after the release of the film, GL had to rewrite the movie and yet you can still catch glimpses of the true Sith Lord in attack of the clones.\n",
            "\n",
            "He will be Supreme Leader snoke in the new movie so get ready for the hype.\n",
            "\n",
            "You people are all blind, open your eyes! \n",
            "\n",
            "626 ) Episode 1 has been cited as one of the biggest disappointments in cinema. Or maybe because people expected too much out of it? I don't know, all I'm saying is that this is my 2nd favorite movie of all time behind Jaws. The story is more mature than all of the Star Wars films, it's about how the Trade Federation wants the Chancellor to sign a treaty to trade routes of the Galactic Republic, but she refuses, and so there is huge chaos around the decision. Meanwhile, Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi plan to train a young Anakin Skywalker. This film is truly wonderful to gaze upon, with underwater cities and dogfights that include a huge amount of imagination. Darth Maul is a more than worthy villain that has lightsaber dueling skills that are undeniably awesome. The characters add enough humor and charm to make the film more lighthearted, particularly the aliens in Naboo and Jar-Jar Binks(whom is a lovable character in my eyes). Overall, TPM is the best of the Star Wars saga and the best sci-fi movie ever made with a more adult plot than most of them, phenomenal visuals, an epic villain, and well-realized and memorable characters. \n",
            "\n",
            "627 ) I was fortunate enough to be a kid when it came out and was engulfed into the whole Star Wars world prior to seeing the movie. My brother and I had collected action figures together, playing out our own stories in the house with them and battling each other. Phantom Menace came along at the perfect time for us, as we were still at the young age of 8-10 and welcomed the new characters/settings to our imagination... Being a movie first, and foremost, it stands alone well on its own with a proper flow of story from beginning to end. Star Wars is all about adventure and the whole movie brings you along on a journey from planet to planet; from going under sea in the inner core of Naboo to meeting Vader as an ace racing podracer on Tattooine and to seeing more of the world of Coruscant, which we had only briefly saw at the end of Return of the Jedi. There is plenty of excitement and fun, and that's what the movie's about. \n",
            "\n",
            "628 ) Perhaps the most unfairly maligned film ever made, The Phantom Menace was more or less my entryway into Star Wars as a child. Sure, I had already seen the Original Trilogy, but the series as a whole didn't really grab me until I watched The Phantom Menace, which ended up being my favorite movie for the majority of my childhood years. I'm not alone in this though, I know many a person from my particular generation who have echoed similar sentiments about Phantom Menace specifically, which, if anything, indicates that the movie must have done something very right. Which, I would argue, it did. Out of all six Star Wars movies, none of them exceed Episode I as a sheer showcase of imaginative power. From the stunningly designed palaces of Naboo, to the undersea depths of Otoh Gunga to the mind-blowingly dense expanse of the Coruscant skyline, no Star Wars movie does better than Phantom in it's power to create jaw-droppingly, perfectly realized worlds and cultures. For what may be the first time in the series' history (with no offense intended towards the Original Trilogy), Lucas's universe feels like more than a colorful backdrop to blaster-slinging antics. It feels fully-realized here, functioning, purposeful. There's an added dimension of life that Phantom specifically created for Star Wars and the universe is forever better off for it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Beyond the world-building, Phantom Menace also begins to weave the incredibly intricate story tapestry that would ultimately blossom into the Prequel Trilogy, little seeds of story are planted and patiently left for future movies throughout Episode I, a testament to the highly undervalued and misunderstood storytelling abilities of George Lucas. Ironically, despite the generalized (and misguided) disdain for The Phantom Menace, it's imagery endures as some of the most iconic in the Star Wars canon. From deep-sea monster-chases to pod-racing to the film's incredibly fun and bombastic finale, Phantom Menace is instantly recognizable and unique. The climactic \"Duel of the Fates\" between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Darth Maul being one of, if not the most iconic fight sequence in cinematic history. At the end of the day, Phantom Menace may not be a flawless picture but it's ambition and imaginative power put the overwhelming majority of blockbuster films to shame. Episode I captured the imaginations of an entire generation of children who grew to become avid Star Wars fans, and that is a legacy that even the most acidic, jaded \"fanboy\" can't erase. \n",
            "\n",
            "629 ) This is not as good as the first star wars movie. The empire strikes back is also better. Return of the j.e.d.i is also better. Attack of the clones is also better. Revenge of the s.i.t.h is also better. But still the Star wars movie are great. This movie as great acting. Great story line. This movie as a lot of action. Great special effects. It has some scary monsters. So did Return of the j.e.d.i. All the Star wars movie are great. Great movie great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it see it see it see it. All the Star wars movie are great. See them all. Jar Jar B.i.n.k.s is not that funny. But he is funner then most comedians. \n",
            "\n",
            "630 ) I can under stand many of the complaints about this movie, but I think most people come up with complaints based on others. Recently the prequel trilogy has been receiving bad criticism by many who hardly know what they're talking about. When this movies was newer it(along with the other prequels)was looked upon as better and more exciting than the original trilogy. I knew many many kids who hardly cared about the original trilogy but was obsessed with the prequels. I think many of these individuals have changed their opinions because of what others think about it. I think if you stop comparing it to the originals, which i equally agree are superior,you will realize it is an amazing movie with great characters and settings. The beautiful thing about the phantom menace is that you get to see how the events in the original trilogy came into place. \n",
            "\n",
            "631 ) Star Wars (before \"A New Hope\" was added) was the first movie I ever saw in the theater, and I fell in love with everything everybody else did. It had an engaging story, interesting characters, great action, and awesome special effects. I was fortunate enough to get to see Empire and Jedi in the theater as well.\n",
            "\n",

            "632 )  I read a lot of bad reviews unfortunately these people are right on the money. You don't have to be a film geek to see how bad this movie is. I honestly miss the old action movies where there is an actual build up to the action so that the action feels intense. The film makers of today need to realize that less is more. No good one liners. They really need to expand on the characters. Jet li was a great action star and they just made him look like a bitch in this movie. I remember when Steve Austin was great in Predator in this movie he couldn't have been more generic. And the action ...geeez I literally fast forwarded the last sequence because it was so boring. Arnold just felt and looked like a wrinkly puppet who's appearance really had no significance at all in the movie. At the end turns out Gunner was alive? and they were all just getting along splendidly like he didn't try to kill them or betray them? Wow. \n",

            "The movie starts with some terrorists on a boat having a bunch of hostages and demanding money. Just when they want to start hurting the hostages, The Expendables show up killing all the terrorists and (miraculously) saving all the hostages. After this opening we meet the Expendable team in person, with the characters Barney Ross(Stallone) and Lee Christmas(Statham) being the main heroes. Stallone receives a new assignment from a man known as Church: assassinate a ruthless dictator of a South American island. Barney and Lee go together to investigate the island and with the help of the attractive rebel leader Sandra they discover the true nature of the conflict. Barney has to make the difficult choice now to just do his job or to follow his heart and help Sandra.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay I know this movie is a homage to 80's action movies but the 'story' feels a bit to much like a 1-on-1 copy of Commando and I couldn't care less about the fate of the island people. In this day and age they could do a better job portraying terrorist other then letting some dudes run around with guns and letting them speak in a foreign language. The scenes where they show the 'bad guys' doing 'bad things' where very boring. Also, the acting of the \"rebel leader\" Sandra was horrible and she didn't come over as an leader at all, just a damsel in distress. But yeah, they wanted to go for that 80's action movie feel where everything meaningful is accomplished by big strong men.\n",

I fail to see beyond the actors though, but I guess that doesn't matter with a movie like this.\n",

            "\n",
            "635 )  The Expendables is an 80's style action movie with an all star cast brought to life by action icon Sly Stallone. Sly was on a roll with excellent sequels to both Rocky and Rambo making a strong comeback to the cinema. Then he made this and rounded up a very good cast of tough guys with Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolf Lundgren,Randy Couture and Terry Crews. The much under rated Eric Roberts is an excellent villain and Steve Austin and Gary Daniels are excellent heavies. Plus cameos from Arnold and Bruce Willis. While this film is in some ways flawed with not too much time to spend on character development and not the best dialouge, I appreciate and enjoy The Expendables regardless. The film looks great and delivers huge on action. Great shootouts, explosions, fighting with fists, knives, feet. It also is very violent and bloody along the lines of the last Rambo film. While not quite as gory or violent as Rambo, the action scenes are bigger and more over the top. The tone of the film is lighter than Rambo and has much in common with the 80's action flicks that this is in the same tradition of. However, this is an ensemble piece and plays like a modern version of The Dirty Dozen. While not as good as The Dirty Dozen, it is a breath of fresh air for me as I am not a fan of most modern action movies that rely on cgi and cast with wimpy actors. The Expendables has a very credible cast of tough actors and brings down the thunder with the firepower and gritty violence much needed in modern cinema. This is not the type of film that critics will praise, but is just what the doctor ordered in an era where the film market does not make films specifically for men anymore, The Expendables are much needed and were a shot in the arm to otherwise lame Hollywood action. Almost a decade has gone by and this holds up pretty well and is much better than the sequels. I did like the second film, but it had too much comedy and was more of an 80's action parody rather than 80's styled action film. The third film was complete garbage and a complete mess and waste of time. \n",
            "\n",
            "636 ) I guess the only reason I was interested in seeing this was because it was the last (or one of the last) movies to ever be reviewed on Siskel and Ebert or Ebert and Roeper or Roeper or whatever. I really didn't need to know anything about the plot at all, given that it was just a movie about a bunch of action stars getting together and blowing stuff up. That's what I thought I was getting and that's exactly what I got. There actually is a major complaint I have. The most famous star of all was Arnold Schwarzenegger and he barely appears in the film at all! I mean, I thought he'd at least appear at the end to rescue everybody.\n",
            "\n",
            "That really did annoy me. Even Bruce Willis didn't have much screen time. So, this movie features a bunch of action scenes and killing in all sorts of ways. The action was decent, but there just wasn't anything that good about the characters. It especially got cliched at the end when they were talking about how the hero and villain were similar and everything. I guess I like the settings. It's just really nothing you haven't seen in many other action movies. I heard Eric Roberts was the most prolific actor out there and it was nice to see him in this movie. **1/2 \n",
            "\n",
            "637 )  Sylvester, I can stand. Even Arnold, he's weirdly calm on screen. Acts like a T-100 even! But Lundgren, holy sh|t, that boy is annoying! And I'm German besides! A very good effort by the demolitions people, I also thought Willis was good as the CIA spook, this movie gave rise to RED and RED 2, apparently, two of my favorites along with Kill BIll. If you can get past the corny locker room jokes, you can watch it. Preferably while getting a decent BJ, makes it more tolerable. BOOM BOOM BOOM... Statham loves that cannon and she digs mine. \n",
            "\n",
            "638 )  Sylvester Stallone's \"The Expendables\" is a good action movie with probably the best ensemble cast for an action movie, and is one of the best action films this decade. The movie focuses on Barney Ross (Stallone) and his team of mercenaries called \"The Expendables\" whose members include Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Yin Yang (Jet Li), Gunnar Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Paine (Steve Austin), and Tool (Mickey Rourke). The team is hired by a man named Mr.Church (Bruce Willis) to kill a dictator who is a fugitive from federal hands and rescue a CIA agent who has been kidnapped. Stallone really knows how to direct a very effective action movie and this is very effective, the action sequences in this movie are expertly choreographed so well that if we were to be one of the bad guys in the movie we would and should be very afraid of a team of action stars like that or as Liam Neeson put it two years earlier in \"Taken\" (2008) \"a special set of skills\". As Roger Ebert once said \"When a movie character is really working we become that character.\" Which is exactly how I felt while watching this really fun movie that is one hell of a thrill ride. The one minor problem I had was with Stallone's and Dave Callaham's screenplay because it doesn't really explain the characters very well. But I was also very impressed in this movie with then California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's cameo in this movie in a church talking to Ross and Church about the mission in a foreign country. But in the end this an action movie that totally worked in my opinion. \n",
            "\n",
            "639 )  I hate to say it because I've been a fan of most of the players here, but the main thing this film did for me was show how old they were all getting to be. Don't take that as a knock, because I'm in my mid-Sixties myself and in good shape, so I can relate to how the Expendables decide to remain relevant in a rapidly changing world. Given the premise, this was bound to be pretty much an over-the-top adrenaline rush for the average fan-boy, but with actors like Willis, Schwarzenegger and Rourke in the cast, one could understandably feel cheated by their in and out appearances in the story. It also didn't surprise me that a lot of the heavy action scenes were filmed almost entirely in the dark, a testament to how impossible it would be for a half dozen guys to take out an army. Which they did as one would expect in a film like this. For me, the best scene was when Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) took out the six dudes on the basketball court. At least that was believable. Yeah right, but considering what he did for a living, maybe he could have pulled it off for real. \n",
            "\n",
            "640 ) This movie is just sad, like an ex-con who was in prison so long, his first instinct is to deep throat the straw of his refreshing beverage. The cast of The Expendables can be divided neatly in three parts, past their prime action heroes, brown people, and Jason Statham. Somebody please tell Sylvester Stallone that he is too old for this s@t, no matter how many face lifts he gets or how much hGH is coursing through his veins. It's really pathetic how many 65 year old men are trying to relive their youth as John McClane these days. What are they gonna in the next one, attach gatling guns to Stallone's walker. Back when everybody was wearing leg-warmers, hanging in 50's themed diners, and doing cocaine, a movie like this would've been ''totally awesome'', but now it's just pitiable.\n",
            "\n",
            "Maybe the problem is that this film was aimed directly at 80's action movie fans and I have never liked them. The Expendables with it's choreographed martial arts and climactic orgy of explosions, fails to impress. I guess the hardcore violence in this flick was cool, but if all I wanted was violence I would have just payed a couple of homeless people to fight. That would have been live entertainment and probably cheaper than the price of admission. \" \n",
            "\n",
            "641 ) With more action movie heroes one could get in a typical action movie. How can it go wrong? Well, it didn't go wrong, but I didn't think it was great either. It was good nevertheless and you gotta respect the men in the movie for it. This movie isn't about drama, so the story can feel shorthanded and the plot kind of thin. But we are not concerned with story or plot (although it has a reasonable plot), because what we want from this movie is to see the action movie heroes we grew up with kick ass! Cheesy lines? Check. One-liners? Check. Predictable plot? Check. Men with big muscles who are more concerned with action than talk? Check. Lots of shooting and explosions? Check. Fight scenes? Check. Car chase? Check. Some good acting? Check. But in some ways I feel it also came kind of short and unoriginal. The characters were mostly the archetype anti-heroes with moral issues and a dysfunctional group, it is a bit like the dynamic you see from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. But I definitely like this movie more than the 'The Avengers', since 'The Expendables' is a little more mature.\n",
            "\n",
            "Sylvester Stallone has done a lot of action movies, often physically demanding and this movie was no exception. He suffered quite some injuries doing the stunts and in the age of 64! Most actors at that age wouldn't even do what he did. Doing scary things with Steve Austin. That I respect. Also Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren had some interesting fight scenes, although the shaky camera made it hard to see what was happening. But it was interesting to see the speedy Jet against the towering Dolph. Jason Statham showed off some skill too, as usual he looked fast and powerful. Randy Couture had some fight scenes too and although he had mostly bit parts he did not impress me any less. The guys were in pretty good shape considering their age. Terry Crews had a memorable scene, with that loud automatic shotgun of his where his character scared off Austin's character. That was funny. Mickey Rourke didn't have fight scenes but he added some delight in the scenes he had with Stallone and Statham. Anyway, I didn't like the CGI special-effects. It were kind of horrible and at times the excess of the movie was too much. But nevertheless I enjoyed the movie so I give it 7/10. \n",

            "642 )  Look i'm an 80's geek i love Stallone & Schwarzenegger so when i saw the trailer and the photos for this movie i just had to see it right now. There's something that always bugged me with this series that people don't get the Expendables are not meant to be taken seriously it's meant to have comic relief and one liners and old people kicking the crap out of younger people it's the same people we all grew up just older and also some new ones like Jason Statham. The team is great you have Sly who nails it every time, Christmas played by Statham who is badass (Basketball scene hell yeah) and also Dolph Lundgren who fights Jet Li and it's pure badass and Steve Austin who should be the main villain because Eric Roberts? totally miscasted here i don't hate him i own and love Best of the Best but going tall to tall with Sylvester Stallone? Yeah No. Other than that EX1 is still a great movie with it's problems and it's highlights. I was going to give the film a 9 but it has a lot of good stuff in it and a really cool bloody opening so yeah 10 out of 10. \n",

            "The third film seemed more like a casting video, with Stallone travelling around and getting new, younger people for his team.

Sure they're in this movie, but for about 2-3 minutes and that's it. For a movie that's main goal is to bring together a bunch of huge action stars and have two of the biggest barely in the movie, let alone hold a weapon or kill anyone is surprising. But, I've surpassed that now, and that's why I prefer the 2nd one over this one. That's not to say this movie doesn't have something going for it.\n",

            "The action is very good here and the actors compliment that. Even if we do have a comedian (Terry Crews) and a UFC fighter (Randy Couture) who aren't even really action stars, but picked more for their physical appearance or abilities. I've grown to love em' though throughout the movies especially Crews. As for the villains though I wish we had some more memorable actors. Like I don't know who the hell David Zayas is or from, and as for Eric Roberts I might have seen him before but I didn't care for him in this movie. The only decent villain was Steve Austin who's role here isn't even that big, but he managed to entertain me with his intimidating and cold, bad-ass performance as \"Paine\" who died in a even more bad-ass way.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also find it ridiculous that Barney and his gang didn't want to do the mission for 5 mill because they believe they wouldn't live to spend it. But, when Barney (Stallone) meets a woman on the island who him and Christmas (Statham) attempt to bring home with them, but she refuses to go. Barney then decides all on his own he's going back for her and his gang as well also decides to tag along just for one woman that he knew for like an hour or two. I guess than there would be no action left for this film and hence that's what these guys are here for and in my opinion they did a good job of entertaining me. Even if I do wish Willis or Schwarzenegger would've got their hands dirty. \n",
            "\n",
            "646 ) This movie begins with pirates seizing a ship in the Gulf of Aden and a couple of months later televising their intent to kill one of the hostages due to the failure of the ship's main company to meet their demands. Just prior to actually killing the hostage a small group of mercenaries appear and the leader named \"Barney Ross\" (Sylvester Stallone) throws a bag full of money to the pirates. However, the leader of the pirates now demands more money and a firefight erupts which ends up with the death of all of the pirates along with the release of the hostages. None of the mercenaries are hurt either. Not long afterward the leader of this elite squad of mercenaries is approached by a CIA operative who goes by the name of \"Mr. Church\" (Bruce Willis) and offered an assignment to kill the military leader of a small island in the Gulf of Mexico. After talking briefly with his team Barney and another member by the name of \"Lee Christmas\" (Jason Statham) decide to go to the island to do a little reconnaissance first. They soon discover that this assignment won't be very easy at all. Now rather than reveal any more of this movie I will just say that it is packed with action from start to finish. So those who enjoy fast-paced action movies will probably like this film quite a bit. On the other hand, those who prefer a certain amount of realism are bound to be somewhat disappointed. Additionally, while Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham and Jet Li (as \"Yin Yang\") certainly had adequate screen time, others like Arnold Schwarzenegger (\"Trench Mauser\"), Mickey Rourke (\"Tool\") and the afore-mentioned Bruce Willis made only cursory appearances which didn't affect the movie one way or the other. What a shame. In any case, although this movie was definitely unrealistic and lacked any depth, it was still entertaining and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average. \n",
            "\n",
            "647 ) Very lame. I guess the story behind the movie goes something like this: Sylvester Stallone decides to make a movie with old buddies, most of whom are, like him, has-beens who never could act anyway (see Dolph Lundgren, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Eric Roberts, Jet Li), though some (Mickey Rourke, Bruce Willis) are pretty good. Decides to throw in some fresh, well-known faces (Jason Statham, David Zayas of Dexter fame) and sports stars (Randy Couture, Steve Austin) to bring in the kids.

It is something we have never seen before in the movies.. putting a cast together that consist of Stallone, Statham, Li, Lundgren, Willis, Schwarzenegger, Rourke, Roberts, Crews, Couture, Austin and making it work! This movie really is perfect for what it is, if you're expecting Oscar performances and top notch acting then don't bother seeing this, this movie is not for you.. but if you want pure action at its best with some eye dropping scenes especially the ending WOW then this movie will be up there on your list as it is mine. The Plot does work in this movie and there is emotion in this, the acting isn't bad because it is what it is, and it delivers. Sly really does a great job directing and writing movies, he proved himself in Rocky and did the same for Expendables.. there will be a sequel to this greatness and I will be first in line as you should be as well to see it!! do yourself a favor and see this if you haven't already!\n",

In fact, there really isn't a single character that stands out from others. Arnold Schwartznegger who's often taken lead roles of action films is blatantly underused, quite disappointing for many action fans. The cast performances aren't terrible, but nothing memorable and the cheesy dialogue certainly doesn't help. However, I found the performances a little more forgiving since these are veteran action stars we are talking about. On the bright side, the film manages to bring out the fun with it's high-kinetic action sequences, soaking the audience with intense 80s-style gun shootouts, blood and guts flying, and just enough explosions to make Michael Bay blush. The only thing that disappoints me about the action scenes is the use of CGI blood which I believe could use some improvement.\n",

Sylvester Stallone leads a band of bad-asses to a war torn country where they blow up everything in sight. The characters are given very little background as it becomes very clear that Stallone's ambition is not in story but in casting every famous action star within reach. It is like a lineup of near retired action stars along with a few newer faces to the genre and nobody gives a sh*t about the whole charade. As director Stallone is more interested in showing off various angles to through a knife or shoot someone. It is one thing for Stallone to round up all of these famous names but why not write them into a story worth telling. This is all bang bang pow and whatever other word they use to describe action. Besides Stallone there is a slew of ass kickers including Jason Statham, Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren among others and they are all given their big chaotic action scene. Stallone plays the desperate hero who goes back into massive danger over a woman. Jet Li gets his ass kicked by Lundgren but we are given that witless conclusion where all is forgiven and Lundgren stands with that stupid grin on his face even though he tried to wrap Li's body around several solid objects. Mickey Rourke was wonderful in The Wrestler, but here he is just along for the ride with his fellow action buddies. This film is expendable in more ways than one and should be backed over by a truck.

            "652 )  The Expendables is very action-packed and entertaining. There were some obvious flaws like a lack of substantial character development and a not-so-original plot. However, this movie did have some of the most realistic and intense hand-to-hand fight sequences I've ever seen and who doesn't like big guns and bigger explosions. The fact that they were able to take so many great action heroes and put them all in the same movie without much sacrifice was amazing. Also, I felt that Mickey Rourke's character was so crucial in added depth and layers to what would otherwise have been a fairly shallow film. The self-absorbed movie critics will hate on this movie because \"it lacked unique cinematic effects\" or whatever cliched criticism they normally say, but if you want to see an action-packed movie with a full cast of action heroes, you won't regret watching this movie. After all, the whole point of cinema is to entertain isn't it? \n",
            "\n",
            "653 )  In 2010, Sylvester Stallone has the idea to take every current and former action star, and put them into a series of movies. The goal was to create the biggest, wildest, most expensive action movies ever made, and have them feature every big name action star from the past 30 years. The studio was so much behind the idea, that not only did they give Stallone a huge budget, but they also approved a sequel, before the first film was even in theaters. It took me 5 years to watch this movie, because I honestly didn't think it was going to work. There is an old saying about having too many cooks in the kitchen, and while trying to include everyone was admirable, I couldn't imagine it working, I was wrong. Stallone leads a freelance para-military organization known as the expendables. These guys work for the highest bidder and do things the government can't. In the first installment of the now billion dollar franchise, the expendables are tasked with stopping a coup on a Caribbean island. If the rival organization takes control, the island would be the largest manufacture of illegal narcotics in the world, and would be impossible to stop, enter the expendables. Sylvester Stallone may be a senior citizen now and still somewhat hard to understand, but when it comes to action movies, you'd be hard pressed to find a better leader. His second in command is currently the largest action star in the world, Jason Statham. Even after seeing hundreds of action movies, including most of Statham's, the guy continues to impress me at every turn. All the strange accents make for an interesting mix of dialogue, but that aside, the story is good, the fight scenes are better, and the special effects are amazing. The Expendables was billed as THE action film to see and it does not disappoint. \n",

They don't take part in any of the action. What a waste ! Mickey Rourke seems like a pointless character . He makes one important , but terribly lame speech that made my head hurt.

I love action films but I don't automatically love all of them, and although this isn't a terrible movie and does offer some old school fun, it does feel rather soulless and lacks charisma. With explosions galore, there's plenty of entertain action junkies and there are a few inspired moments and high octane stupidity. In one of the great good scenes in bad movies, Mickey Rourke actually acts and delivers a powerful speech on a war he once thought in. However, none of the others are particularly great. Sylvester Stallone is particular has trouble changing his facial expression even once. His direction is acceptable, but also ugly and artificial at times.

In general, the film just barrels on from one loud incomprehensible set piece to the next and even though it's meant to be a tribute to old school action it doesn't even feel that light or over the top a lot of the time and feels too cowardly to actually hit hard. When people talk about loud and noisy action garbage this is the sort of thing they are talking about. While I don't agree with those who dislike action movies, they have a strong piece of evidence here. It's a moderately watchable film and at times I was enjoying it but since the film is like a zombie walking through a graveyard of action cliches, this could be mistaken for some awful flick about zombie action heroes. Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis both appear, but sadly they're reduced to cameos. The Expendables 2 sounds OK, but I shudder to think of The Expendables 3 which is apparently even worse.\n",

The Expendables is an entertaining stupid movie but most of that entertainment comes from the stars and how fun it is to see all these actors come together and kick some ass together. But the flaw is that none of these stars has an real character unless Stallone, Statham, Rourke and Lundgren.

            "\n",
            "The film was written by Sylvester Stallone and Dave Callaham. While the story and the setup isn't anything Oscar worthy, it fits a film like this perfectly. The film never needed to be flashy in the story department, and they never tried to be. Stallone is well known for over the decades for his roles in the drama genre like with the Rocky films and even the first Rambo film, First Blood. However, his action movie history is long and it is stellar. Callaham recently helped write the newest American Godzilla film but, is more known to us action fans as a writer of this Expendables franchise. The story as I said is nothing perfect but, it does sell you nicely on some of the background and build up over the film. While I wouldn't say there are any classic lines like Stallone is use to delivering in his action films, there are still some funny lines that you will be remembering. The film does drag early in the film as maybe they take the story too deep but, when the action really gears up, it is non stop until the very end. So in this department Stallone and Callaham get a nice passable grade for their writing.\n",
            "\n",
            "This film was also directed by Sylvester Stallone. While over the years some have complained about the use of the so called shaky cam, I personally never once thought the action was unwatchable. While Stallone isn't known as a great action director, he really takes this film into his own, and with plenty of amazing action scenes, he shows just how his past experience has payed off. I'm a huge fan of the 80s and 90s action movies, and so many of those movies had over the top pieces of action. Well if you are like me then you will not want to pass up this film. While the start of the film is slower, from about the middle to the very end there are so many over the top action pieces that you would have thought you put in an 80s action film. While those cheesy one liners aren't as big in this film, the action is just about on the same level. Now on to the actors, or should I say legends of past action films. Of course everyone knows Stallone stars in the film but, we also get to see Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Let Li. The film as features some up and coming action stars like Steve Austin, Jason Statham, Gary Daniels, and Terry Crews. While you can easily say Lundgren or even Stallone steal the show, I must personally say that Terry Crews steals the show with his amazing scene towards the end of the film. Once you watch the film you will instantly know what I am talking about. The stars of the film are amazing together, and it is a real joy to see so many greats in one film together. Stallone gets high praise for his directing this film and for being able to bring so many of our favorites into one film.\n",
            "\n",
            "Brain Tyler composed the score for this film. He is the composer of all the Expendable films, and has even recently done work on bigger films such as Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World. While I personally love those cheesy scores from composers of the 80s, this score from Tyler doesn't really hold up against those films, and frankly no one should have expected it to, as this is a completely different day and age with much different technology. While I can't say Tyler does a great job, his score is good enough for this amazing film.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, everyone should see this film at some point. Sure it may not be as amazing as those 80s action films but, Stallone and company give a fantastic effort, and this film should not be ignored. Huge fans of the genre have already watched this film many times over, and get excited every time a new film is released. If you haven't started watching these films yet, now is the perfect time. In my opinion, you will not regret giving this film a chance.\n",

            "667 ) I remember reading about this in Total Film a few years back that after Sly revived Rocky & Rambo he was looking to recruit a squad of tough guys for what was being tagged as the ultimate action movie, and to say I was excited was understatement. Names were being thrown around left, right & centre on who would be in it. If the latest Rambo(2008) was anything to go by I knew this was going to be ace, or so I thought, well almost.\n",
            "\n",
            "I reviewing this with the run up to EX3 just days away from release, and thought I'd start at the start. So watching this back (with Sly both behind, and in front of the camera) its a real throwback to everyone's favourite 80's flicks, there is real sense that Sly is trying to give us a real insight into the guys in the film (especially with Sly/Mickey/Jason's character) it worked more with Rambo as Sly is the only big name in the film, where as with all the names here even the poster was struggling to fit them in, but then again non-one is watching this for an Oscar nomination as its an action fest, just how it should be.\n",
            "\n",
            "The action scenes are thick, fast and brutal but arrive in batches more towards that latter part of the film. In all honestly I did like Rambo more as action was its main driving force, Sly really want to deliver some plot and it does slow the film down at times, but I think he knows that as come the second film he steps down as Director and the balance of EX2 has way more laughs, even bigger names and action. So to sum up its great start to what could be a great franchise The one distracting factor throughout this and the 2nd film is the CGI is pretty poor and Rambo for that matter I notice that Lionsgate is behind these films so makes me question if its down to them) One more thing is Ex is rated at 18, EX2 at 15 and EX3 at 12A which sounds to me the violence is going to be pretty toned down but allows more bums on the seats so only time will tell. \n",
            "\n",
            "668 ) Is it just me that thinks this film could have had so much more to it? Yes? No? Because in actuality, Action Films are better than this - at least the ones done properly, anyway. I already reviewed Expendables 2 because honestly, I love it - the faults I have with this one, though, are bigger and they stick out more. Ah well, not all films are perfect. Obviously you're aware of the fact that Austin and Stallone collide and face-off against each other. What even was that, guys? In all honesty that fight should have ended up much differently. Stallone got his ass handed to him, I mean, Austin literally beat the crap out of him, when Barney Ross (Stallone) is meant to be the meanest, toughest mercenary in recent-years.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Expendables ends with the main bad guy getting killed, and Eric Roberts wasn't really a threat at all, if you ask me. It's not the same as the second one, when it's JCVD; he's definitely a bigger threat who's more superior. Even the second one has a better co-villain, and that's Scott Adkins, he's a huge threat in comparison to Eric Roberts, in this one.\n",
            "\n",
            "I did love the film, in some ways admittedly. I mean, it had some of the biggest action-stars of all-time in it, that's a great treat for us retro-lovers and action-fans. Schwarzenegger should have had a bigger and better role in it, though. Luckily Schwarzenegger appears a lot throughout the second one. The Expendables is a bit of an old-school thrill-ride with some badass weaponry and great moments of far-fetched action. Enjoy it if you've not seen it yet, guys. Admittedly, it is a pretty great action-extravaganza. 7.3/10. \n",
            "\n",
            "669 )  Everyone thought this may be a flop due to all the stars within it, like a clash of ego's but they worked so well and such a great film Stallone was a genius within this Terry Crews is just a great actor and great whatever he is in Jet Li brought a contrast of what strength is Jason i am not usual a fan of but was a great addition to this movie It has just improved more and more on each film released the more stars the more risk but so fan they have done so well Well Done on the film and a Great story line. I now just have to fill the rest because apparently I haven't written enough, Lucky i haven't written any spoilers within this otherwise my account would be blocked lol. \n",
            "\n",
            "670 ) Okay this movie didn't totally suck, but in my point of view it wasn't great either. I hoped the movie would be more like RED, because then I liked it.\n",
            "\n",
            "I didn't like the script, the one-liners weren't even that great. I hope for some cheesy one-liners after a big fight or a big boom, but it fell flat to the ground. I really question the intelligence of some people in this film, like Gunner. He's totally nuts and he doesn't make sense. First he is good, then he tried to kill Yin Yang and in the end he is good again and everybody accepted him, while he was kicked out in the beginning ?! It's just silly and stupid.\n",
            "\n",
            "I also find it very weird that Arnold Swarzenegger and Bruce Willis where on the front of the DVD case. They made a 3 minute appearance ?! like what the hell, they are not even that important, more like: I show my face then we can get paid and more people will go to the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "The special effects where meh. It was so obviously fake it wasn't even funny... While we where an hour in the movie I could feel my thoughts drifting away and before I know it I was thinking about other stuff en 'missed' 30 minutes of the movie. But I didn't miss it, really, because when I was back again it was still the same fighting when I drifted away.\n",
            "\n",
            "I eventually gave it a six, because it wasn't entirely bad, but it isn't my movie. I think I will skip the expendables 2 and directly move on to expendables 3, because it is almost in cinemas here. \n",
            "\n",
            "671 )  A good movie..rather, one of my favorites. I'm not an action flick kind of person but I do enjoy an adrenaline laced lifestyle when affordable. I think the critics are highly biased and just plain negative when it comes to reviews (they expect high dollar, blockbuster masterpieces and nothing short of that). Many people are too, when the subject of Stallone's acting or directing rise. He's an actor, so to expect award winning directorial work is naive. A damn good one. Even in this film, he still maintains his rep, though watered down a bit. An action film with fans that hope for romance and comedy? Although the film supplies little of both (its action so what do you expect?), it provides enough to develop the characters for the storyline. To learn how to shape expectations may never be mastered. But to realize a good film given the efforts of actors and directors both despite its shortcomings is something we should be familiar with, especially since many classic films cannot be matched, merely \"redone.\" I liked this movie quite a bit and was intrigued by negative reviews and so decided to put my two cents in. Thanks for reading. \n",
            "\n",
            "672 ) My expectations for the Expendables were extremely high with the potential for some of the best on screen fights. I was expecting something equal to the Bruce Lee v Chuck Norris fight in the Way of the Dragon. But unfortunately what could have been one of the greatest action movies of all time ended up being nothing more than a generic action with little memorability other than its cast.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ultimately the film is centred around one gimmick. Get the biggest action stars and put them together on screen. At first the premise sounds like a good one, but the problem is that its a tough idea to get right. With so many people in one film it becomes difficult to let any of them shine as they would on a lone outing since they get quite little screen time. What would usually seem cool like machine gunning a room full of bad guys feels mundane when everyone else in the film is doing it too. Also many of the names don't get much more than a cameo with both Willis and Schwarzenegger getting less than 5 minutes of screen time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Possibly you could make the premise work with a really good script that can juggle all the characters as films like Ocean 11 had done before it. But unfortunately Stallone was not up to the job. Unlike the action movies that made us love these stars, it has no memorable moments. He seemed more relied on the cast to make the film work than using the script to make the actors more effective. The actors do their best to bring some charm to the film and at times it can lead to some cool moments but not often.\n",
            "\n",
            "The fights seem to blend together since nothing seems to happen other than a lot of explosions and endless numbers of faceless bad guys dying. Watching these fights actually bugged me to see how the actions have changed since those iconic ones of the 70's and 80's. Instead of the realistic blood pouches they used to use, we now only see extremely fake VFX blood splatter. This mixed with the fake gunfire draws little interest in to any of the action scenes and makes it far weaker than those classic actions that it's trying to duplicate.\n",
            "\n",
            "Plus all of the dialogue is so dull and adds little personality to these heroes. There's no \"I am the law\" or \"I'll be back\" lines that will have us quoting these films for years. The best the film will give is a wink to the audience by referencing these lines instead of making its own memorable lines. The script tries to capitalise on out love of great actions instead of making one itself.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you're a fan of any of the stars it may be worth watching as it's still an OK action. But the only way to get the best of any of these actors is watching them on their own. \n",
            "\n",
            "673 )  Going into watching this film you just simply must know what you were getting into an action film with one liners. This film has almost everybody in it but the main two are director Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham as the main members of the all star group The expendables who set out to take out a dictator and liberate a nation. The performances are what you would expect and great for this film every single one of them, also some awesome cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger who I hope to see both in the sequel more. The action is fantastic throughout but the last action scene oh my goodness is some of the best action there is ever and is clearly the best part of the film as expected. Dolph ludgren as the crazed ex member of the team was a cool dynamic also stone cold Steve Austin is great in action and Eric Roberts is an awesome villain like he always is. However, for a mindless action film there is some slow parts which I could have done without. Also I would have liked the characters of jet li, randy cetoure and terry crews to be expanded more instead. But this is an awesome film filled with everything you would expect. \n",
            "\n",
            "674 ) THIS is how one makes a soulless action movie: by taking a cast of likable and somewhat cliched group of characters who are in to Creedence Clearwater Revival and put them through increasingly unforgiving gunfights.\n",
            "\n",
            "But the Expendables isn't soulless. There are some moments that you can see the weight of the characters' pasts when they talk about some of the horrible sheit they've been through. There's a very subtle love interest for Stallone's character, Barney Ross, which never kisses him, fawns over him, or tries to sleep with him. The most they share is a hug at the very end.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of the action celebrities are more or less playing culminations of their various roles in the past, none of which have believable names. But, to be honest, you probably won't care about their names because there is WAY too much crap trying to kill them for you to care.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is probably the most '80s action movie I've ever seen. It makes the action scenes bigger and bigger and the characters more and more cliched until you have one giant testosterone-fueled explosion of one-liners and, um, explosions.\n",

            "676 ) It's probably no Surprise that the Script never rises above Sophomoric and that most of the Movie is Moronic, and that Viagra is for Sissies. This is nevertheless what it is supposed to be. A Testosteronian Tale of almost Over the Hill Mercenaries played by Over the Hill Action Stars. Is it Nostalgic Fun? There is precious little Fun here. Even the Lame One-Liners are Sparse. It is all about Strutting and comparing, well, You know.\n",

            "\n",
            "Speaking of Focus. The Movie's Greatest Failing is a Modern Technique used in most Action Movies Today. A Combination of Shaky Camera and Quick Cutting. It is a Numbing and Nauseating effect that does not do all the Time and Money spent on the Thing a bit of Justice. It is virtually Impossible to distinguish Who or What is going on, except that Something is and Someone gets Dead or Destroyed very Loud and very Quick. \n",
            "\n",
            "677 ) I am not sure what to say... Stallone should spend more money on the movie rather than on the cast. It's hard to see what actually happened especially in the fight scenes which is the most important thing in this movie. The movie wasn't funny at all, the shooting and explosions wasn't close too good, illogical scenes and the list goes on.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a big fan of Stallone I am truly disappointed and sad at the same time. I like all of his movies that I have seen; while some are better than others, but this one I didn't enjoy for one minute. I hope that The Expendables 2 is better.

An absolute blast from the past (depends on ur age though,mine is 37 so it certainly does hold true).Like the proverbial \"put your feet up\", get a chilled pack of your favorite drink,a big cheeseburger,crank up the receiver a wee bit than usual (never mind the neighbors,they usually come without a sense of occasion). And what you have is the stage all set to blow you away.And when it ends this movie makes you say wow, that was something.

            "This is not Pride & Prejudice, nor is it Blade Runner.

            "With previous credits including 3 of the Rocky movies, plus the Rambo remake, Stallone is no slouch when it comes to having an eye for a good action movie.

            "\n",
            "The story, a flimsy load of nonsense, is just a vehicle in this movie to travel from one explosive action scene to another, and quite simply it works brilliantly.

            "\n",
            "What IS surprising is the level of acting and characterisation - while in places the voice clarity is very poor, nevertheless the narrative in terms of the protagonists is actually half decent, and the viewer genuinely wants Sly and his chums to succeed. A little touch of class was casting Mickey Rourke and his brief monologue in the middle works because you buy him - we saw him in the Wrestler as a hopeless case and he achieves it here too. Mainly because while the words are fake, the emotion is real given Rourke has hardly had an easy ride.\n",

This would be a problem if anything that was being said was important or required for understanding of the plot, but it isn't, because the plot is a straight line from A to B, entirely one dimensional, so you can fill in the gaps yourself, if you even notice them. On the subject of sound, it is even more uneven than your standard Hollywood blockbuster, but you are not missing much by dialling things down to save your eardrums during the action sequences. There's an amiable buddy-buddy bonhomie running through the script that is enjoyable, and the action well done, and includes the best water plane escape scene since Raiders of the Lost Ark, but overall The Expendables is cliched and predictable. That's all very well, regrettable, but not objectionable, and it seems clear that this was the film's low-set aspiration anyway, however when you are literally falling asleep during the 'climactic' assault on the evil general's headquarters, I think you can safely say that the film's value as mindless entertainment, it's only real selling point, is limited. \n",

They are doing reconnaissance for a job to take out the dictator of the island. Ross and Christmas witness local soldiers terrorizing the citizens of the island and being directed by James Munroe (Eric Roberts) and Paine (Steve Austin). The best part of the whole scene is when Ross and Christmas escape the island, but end up taking out the dock area they landed their plane. The do this, Christmas first fires Browning M2 Aircraft machine guns quad-mounted into the nose of the plane. Then fuel is dumped on the dock, dousing the remaining soldiers and Munroe and Paine, Christmas then fires a M8 Flare Pistol at the dock to ignite the fuel.\n",

            "The next scene I liked was when Christmas gets home he goes over to his girlfriend's house only to find that she, Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) is seeing another guy. Lacy explains that she only moved on because even when Christmas was home he wasn't really home, and that she really didn't know him. But the best scene for this little triangle is when Christmas goes to Lacy's house and discovers that her boyfriend, Paul (Hank Amos), has hit Lacy. Christmas and Lacy get on his motorcycle to go have a chat with Paul. Paul is playing basketball with a five or six other guys when Lacy and Christmas show up. Christmas takes out every single one of them, leaving them alive, but tells Paul that the next time he comes near Lacy and lays a hand on her he will deflate all of Paul's balls.\n",

            "The best scene by far is the scene in which Ross and Christmas, along with the other members of their mercenary force, storm the President's Palace on Vilena. They are doing this to take out the dictator, General Garza (David Zayas), as well as Munroe and Paine. They are also trying to rescue Sandra (Giselle Itie'), General Garza's daughter. Near the end of the scene Munroe has a gun pointed at Sandra and he asks Ross why he was coming after him; Ross answers that he was coming for the girl not him, and then shoots Munroe several times before Christmas throws a knife through his chest.\n",

It seems Stallone wasn't quite up to the admittedly Hurculean task of writing/directing/starring in The Expendables. There were too few great moments of interaction between the characters, not enough witty banter, not enough chemistry between the characters. Having seen the making of and behind the scenes footage of the expendables, it seems like Sly relied too heavily upon ad-libbing and improvisational dialogue due to his guerrilla style film-making approach. The action scenes were pretty forgettable, with the notable exception of the dual 50 cal/ flare gun dock explosion scene. Stallone and Statham get top billing and screen time, but Mickey Rourke steals the show with his dialogue on salvation and damnation. Dolph Lundgren upstages everyone else with his sheer presence alone. Jet Li's character gets some good screen time and one of the films best fight sequences, but again his dialogue is awkwardly written. Eric Roberts does an adequate job in the villain role, but couldn't they have found a better actor to go up against this dream team of Hollywood titans? The rest of the cast is generally pushed aside and given only brief screen time which fails to leave much of an impression. Sadly the entire thing manages to underwhelm and seems to underline the fact that most of these guys best days are behind them. Which is a shame when so many of us fans were hoping for a glorious return to form. Still, The Expendables is worth watching, just keep your expectations realistic. 6/10. \n",

I'd seen a few of Schwarzenegger's movies but most of them in his appeal to kids phase until I went back in the 90s and saw a few of his more popular films. Die Hard with a Vengeance was probably the only of the series that really spoke to me for a long time. So it's not as if I haven't seen my fair share of movies from that era but they never really did much for me as films. I never had that \"Wow that was so cool I want to do that moment.\" that a lot of filmmakers have with them. Maybe it's because as a child of the 90s I spent a lot of my 80s years watching John Hughes films and the huge swath of comedies from that era.\n",

Not as it turns out enough interest to actually go see the film in theatres. I had enough misgivings about the film to wait until it came out on DVD to see it, and in doing so I realize that I was right. The film, like many of the era these films harken back to, just doesn't have enough juice in it to sustain a whole hour much less the under 2 hours the film actually has. The characters are underdeveloped and some are basically useless plot devices, the villain is basically half-assed and under used, and the only decent story worth telling was given to a secondary character and not followed through on.\n",

Unfortunately depth and emotional honesty are not the point of a film like this and so they get relegated to C plot devices when the A and B plots haven't been any more secured then the plan to liberate an island by blowing up a single part of it with barely any of the army which is holding it hostage inside.\n",

Stallone in particular given that he is one of the only of the group to win a Best Picture Oscar.

The cast includes Stallone, Statham, Li, Austin, Crews, Couture, Rourke, Willis, Schwarzenegger, and my personal favorite Lundgren. In case you don't know who he is he is Drago from Rocky 4. I heard some people complain that the movie was stupid and had no story and point. To that I say, duh, that's not the point.

I did not go see this movie for deep characters and an in-depth storyline. I saw this for the action and special effects. For an action movie, I loved it, for a movie in general, it was one of the worst I have ever seen. Stallone leads a group of mercenaries and he gets too attached to a job and he wants to return to rescue a girl. I guess the first rule of being a mercenary is not to get attached to the job. It's get in, get out, and get paid. For what it is it wasn't a terrible idea. If it had to be a story I'm glad it was this one.\n",
            "\n",
            "A major flaw with the move itself is the fact that it tries too hard to be a movie that it isn't. After an action packed opener they go back home and try to dig into characters and that's not necessarily a bad thing but they tried too hard. Stallone has his internal conflict and talks it over with Rourke, and that's OK, but the whole story with Statham and his girlfriend could have been cut out and replaced with him snapping necks. I don't want to see Bruce Li complain about his family that doesn't exist or Mickey Rourke being completely useless throughout the entire movie. I hated his character. All he does is ride in, be a sad old man, and give tattoos. He tells this story about an old job and how he got attached to it and I was just turned off. I wanted him out of the movie. He is an action star and should have been that. Instead he was a has-been and drags the movie along. Even Stallone looked like he was getting bored. Bruce Willis' character was OK, I wanted to see him kill people too but instead he plays the guy who assigns the job and that's it. Anybody could have played that role and he was wasted as a name to promote the movie. I was OK with Schwarzenegger's character because he was governor at the time so it made sense. I guess I should praise the real point of the movie, the action. Nothing made me happier than seeing Terry Crews mow people down with a shotgun. The car chase with Stallone, Li, and Lundgren was impressive. It had the stupid one liner but cars flipping and bullets flying are what I wanted to see. Some of these actors are getting old but the gritty hand to hand combat still held up. The explosions in the beginning were just as good as the ones at the end. Stone Cold Steve Austin is in the movie as a bad guy and he fit in surprisingly well. He played a bad guy in the WWF so he knows what he is doing. His scenes were fun to watch and he was a good addition. Overall, The Expendables was exactly what I expected. It was a battle of men and a movie for a man. If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, I hope she broke up with you on the spot. The acting was gross, he story was choppy and stupid, but that wasn't the point. When people tell me this movie was bad I laugh and ask what they expected. I expected the bloodbath that I got so I was happy. As a movie it is terrible, but as an action movie it is top notch. The Expendables gets the WillyT Bloodbath Badge. That basically means it was a good action movie. If I had to give it a real WillyT Rating it gets the WillyT Recommendation because it is a movie every man needs to see to consider himself a man. \n",

One of the best action movies of recent years, doesn't take itself too seriously and it being a box office success goes to show that action movies today does not have to use that serious and realistic Bourne look that people seem to copy these days. This is a throwback to the 80s and 90s films where you had Schwarzenegger and Stallone piling up the bodies of bad guys, creating characters with cheesy yet memorable quotes. Sly Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke and Bruce Willis (in a small role) were brilliant.

My favorite was after this abusive guy hits Lacy (Charisma Carpenter) the woman he loves, he beats the you know what out of him and his friends, taking his knife to the basketball, slashing it, and telling Lacy \"Now you know what I do for a living.\" (He did not want her to know he was a mercenary. But he knew that although she loved him, in order to have her, he had to come clean).

It is also aware of itself as a film: the dialogue makes the viewer understand that the actors are in a movie and not taking anything seriously which wasn't the right decision in my mind because it weakened the film too much: it became too dull and lacked any dramatic impact as I knew everything wasn't happening \"for real\" and since this film isn't art: it's soundtrack and visuals aren't artsy but are simple action tropes, thus it cannot be understood as art but only as an action movie that depends on tension to create a situation. \n",

            "I love action movies and I don't like being negative, but I have to say I think this movie is a bit of a wasted opportunity. It has a dream cast, great locations (the fictional island of Vilena was shot in Rio De Janeiro state), tons of fights, chases, stunts and explosions but for me it makes two classic blunders - the characters are all clods and the action is poorly choreographed. For a big budget film with such a prestigious international cast it looks and feels remarkably like any old Chuck Norris / Jean-Claude Van Damme / Steven Seagal action knock off. The fights, car chase in the middle and especially the big set piece storm-the-castle-and-blow-everything-up ending are all cut so fast, with little or no suspense, that it becomes just a fireworks show. None of the characters are developed and only Statham manages to add any kind of pathos or context to the action. It isn't a good sign when I find myself identifying most with backstabbing psychotic drug lord Roberts, because at least he's intelligent and has an ideology he sticks to. Criticism aside though, the movie does redeem itself with that cast; Stallone and Statham make a good double act, Li injects some much needed deadpan humour, Lundgren is agreeably over-the-top, and there are four champ wrestling/sports/martial-arts B-movie stars in Couture, Crews, Austin and Daniels. It moves along fast enough, and although there are no surprises as a park-your-brain blood-and-thunder actioner it's good fun. For bonus points, there's also an early scene in a church featuring Stallone with an unbilled Willis and Schwarzenegger which must surely be officially the most on-screen testosterone in the history of cinema. Followed in 2012 by a direct sequel. \n",

Still, their previous efforts were, to a certain degree, effortlessly charming. With this most recent blow-em-up, the stars of the show namely Stallone and Statham do manage to bring some personality to an otherwise meat-headed testosterone-fest, but the feeling that it was made simply as a cash grab to try and reel in fans of '80s action movies is undeniable.\n",

There's also the sense that what we're witnessing is a tad bit...I don't know... sad.

Now, in the end I did enjoy most of it and would definitely check out the sequel, but what spoilt it for me was Sly's heavy-handed direction and mechanical dialogue. The action is filmed way too frantically, extremely up close with very quick cuts so it's almost impossible to tell what's going on and to who (a problem also in the recent A-Team remake.) The finale was just a fiery and explosive blur, which ultimately takes the intensity and the audience out of the action and feeling very detached. I see this as important because the film is a love letter to old action flicks. What made the action in The Dark Knight so tense was that it was approached methodically, very few quick cuts used to make it seem more realistic and little shaky cam. The Expendables camera shakes like an earthquake's hit it! There's also a problem with the odd really bad CGI effect, making the film seem cheaper than it is. However, I did enjoy the comedy aspect and the banter.

You hate him when he kills the young guy from Barney's team.Jason Statham is classy again in this movie.

I am even more miffed by the people who took them seriously, and decided to let them influence their opinion of the movie. The Expendables is a movie with good dialouge, great acting, great action, and an interesting storyline. No, it does not deserve 10/10 (more like 8 or 8.5/10), but my exaggeration is based on the fact that the stars are so fantastic, that just them being all together raises the movie beyond its basic merits. \n",

It blends brutally choreographed melee, explosions and gunfights, with each one of the Expendables having their fair share of the action. However, although the film is satiatingly steeped in aestheticised violence, I did find that some of the CGI violence wasn't as tangible as I'd have liked, I prefer old fashioned squibs and syrup.

There are some notable names missing from the cast, but thankfully there's scope for a whole Expendables franchise, giving many other fan favourites an opportunity to become an Expendable. This is probably the first time that I've found myself wanting a mindless blockbuster franchise to come to fruition; with a team of cine-literate, witty writers, the possibilities are almost endless for potential sequels. Who knows, the film could even attract some heavyweight talent in the form of Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino - 'The Expendables' could add further dimensions to its celebration of masculinity!\n",

After being contracted to assassinate the dictator of a small republic, Barney deems the mission suicidal at first but has a change of heart when an innocent's life is at stake.

Sylvester Stallone and Jason Stathom receive most of the attention as they are in more action scenes and more scenes in general. They also receive the most character development. And Jet Li fans might be a bit disappointed as his highlight moment of the film actually makes him look kind of weak. The other members are simply underused.

Stallone said multiple times before the release of this film that this is a tribute to the hard R action movies of the 1980's. Hence the ensemble of some of the most iconic action stars of the 80s and 90s being in this movie. Does it have hammy acting? Yes (Although Dolph Lundgren gives a surprisingly good performance and steals the show in the few scenes he is in). Does it have a cliche plot? Yes.

This would've been awesome, but it's ruined by the fact that it was spoiled in the trailers and the dialog in the scene is just awful! Another thing is that a lot of the cast doesn't get a lot of screen time. Everyone except for Stallone and Statham get like only 20 to 30 minutes of screen time.

Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Willis together in a moment from the same film, something that should have happen a long time ago, way back in the 1990's when they were at the top of their game as the greatest action heroes of the period. It took a long time to get here, to get this brief encounter made reality but better late than never.\n",

            "Made almost with the same extravagance of the 1980's action flicks but not with the same greatness and effectiveness, \"The Expandables\" recycles an heavy cliched plot about good mercenaries taking down from the power a corrupt and tyrannic dictator of a South America country supported by a CIA agent (Eric Roberts) and his malign plans. But the appeal here is seeing the group's member, the so-called Expendables: Stallone joins Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Mickey Rourke, the last one playing a friend of the team but retired from all the action. Now, the other side is composed by Steve Austin, Gary Daniels (but you can't barely see his face) and a few others. Willis and Schwarzenegger are merely cameos but there's no problem in that, they're part of our fun in watching the movie. And it wouldn't be a complete work without a girl to help those guys, the dictator's daughter, played by Gisele Itie.\n",

            "Theme and plot are quite similar to many others developed in action films made since the 1980's up until now, but without causing some of the everlasting impact some of those movies caused on us, specially when it comes to the action scenes. Let's face it: the heroes are the same but the Hollywood system has changed a lot in order to get bigger audiences and to do that they get a little bit drenched with a politically correct agenda avoiding problems with the final product and editing/censorship issues. With that I mean that \"The Expendables\" is quite controlled in terms of violence, Stallone doesn't make of this such a visceral and heavy thing like \"John Rambo\" was, where half of the villains had their body parts flying around shattered by knives and machine guns. Good thing to some, but the movie isn't so memorable for the action sequences (they're good,being the most impactant the first guy killed in the movie, he simply disappeared after one shot fired) but it stays in the memory because of its use of humor. Gotta admire the priceless moment with Statham reciting a poetry in a bar, or Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren fights, or Li wanting to get more money for his work because he needs to pay for the school of his alleged kids.\n",

Eric Roberts plays the typical skeevy sleaze bag hes so good at, stone cold.....what a MONSTER. this guy is scary, and plays a formidable foe to sly and his gang of freedom fighters. mickey Rourke provides the heart and soul and the movie, with one truly amazing scene where he talks about how he could have saved his soul by saving another's. almost brought tears to my eyes. in short, this is probably one of THE best most fulfilling action experiences in recent years. in a time filled with CGI overload and everything seems to take itself so seriously, here comes a movie that doesn't try to be anything other then a simple giant blockbuster filled to the brim with brutal fist fights and explosions. i hope Hollywood is taking notes here: THIS is how to make an proper action movie, the way they USED to make them. the movie has it all, and i am really hoping the sequel will be just as good, if not better. \n",

It has to be very hard, all those stars, who are usually working alone, to join them for one movie. And they really clicked, it was chemistry between them. I admire that, and as a action lover, i really enjoyed this movie. It's full of action, and great dialog. Story isn't complicated, so you won't be confused at any time. Like i said, old fashion action movie. Don't expect nothing else or you will be disappointed. But every action lover, will love this movie like me. \n",

Pretty much every name from action films was mentioned. Then the biggest rumour of them all, it was going to star Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger!

He wins us over in the first frame, because he is one among us. It is not his heroism which makes him surreal, but his vulnerability which makes him endear-able. The audience falls in love with Bernie Ross because he is scared of the unknown just like us. What makes him a hero is his conviction and spirit, which makes him embark on a nationwide journey for the search of love and faith.

He goes by the doctrine of his Grandma, who taught him that there are two classes of people in the world, those who are good and would offer a lollipop and those who are bad and would point a gun. There is no caste, creed or religion but just people who shape the world. It is this philosophy which Ross carries forward in his love and faith, painting his journey in a collage of alternate light and dark emotions, shadow plays of human nature which guides him to the world or perhaps, guides the world towards him.\n",

The keynotes of each frame, drenched with subtle social comments and complex emotional undertones makes the movie an amalgamation of the colors of hope and persistence, with layered textures of unspoken bonds. With Ross, Stallone succeeds in bringing the system on trial through the eyes of one who cannot bias himself on any ideology, making his emotions pure and though provoking, which touches the innermost chords of the heart, moistening the eyes and serenading the senses.\n",

The script penned by Stallone is one of par excellence, allowing the audience to blend into Ross through his smiles and tears, laugh in his joy and cringe with every blow dealt to him. The screenplay drops hypocritical moral ambitions to make scathingly relevant comments on modern outlook of the world, making it rise several notches above anything attempted in Hollywood.\n",

Stallone exudes the spirit of the titular Expendables in every breath and pulse of the film, putting in a performance that is beyond any benchmark of excellence. He controls every single emotional nerve of the audience with vacant stares and dimpled smiles, towering like an illusionist conjuring up a magical performance of a lifetime. He breaks every stereotypical mould attached to him to rise like a phoenix from the ashes with Ross, who reigns over the audience in a sweeping wave of emotions, establishing a bond that scales beyond the arc-lights of the 70mm screen. He is complimented by those others whose very presence lights up the entire rooms with just their flashing smiles. He balances the sensitivity of love and charm with the emotional conflict of a ravaged heart with effortless poise. The interactions between Ross and his expendables form the highlights of the film, filled with the cackling chemistry of a uninhibited passion, captivating the audience in the mesmerizing spell of the couple. Jason Statham as Ross's cohort delivers a matured and restrained performance while Dolph Lundgren as Gunner Jensen blends in simplicity with sensibility in a performance that comes straight from the heart. Mickey Rourke is exceptional as the young freedom fighter, \"Tool\" in his mannerisms while the supporting cast all deliver credible performances including Arnold Schwarzenegger in a dazzling cameo.\n",

The Expendables is undoubtedly the new face of global cinema that enthralls with each passing frame, healing the hidden scars of the heart with its message of a better and humane world. There might be superheroes, but there will ever be one Barney Ross, who takes pride in being ordinary and yet changes the face of the world.\n",

            "719 ) What matters is family, you pick a side and you stay on that side, if you switch side, you're the enemy and will forever be the enemy until you're dead. You look out for your family, and make sure everyone is okay. You don't discuss business at the table when having dinner. Power and Money - \"Business\" comes second! It's the Corleone family against Barzini and Tattaglia and 3 other mob leaders. The Corleone family is the biggest most powerful mafia family in New York, and the family you turn to if you need a problem to disappear. A lot of blood is spilled and Don Vito Corleone also known as the Godfather (Brandon Marlon) is almost killed in a shooting by another gang. Mike and Sonny are his sons. Sonny is his right hand at first until one day when he gets killed by a gang after going after his sisters boyfriend for assaulting her. Then Mike steps in and takes over, Don Vito gets older and more cripple and soon he dies too, that's when Mike (Al Pacino) becomes the new Godfather, and kills the 5 mafia leaders, to take control over New York, and eliminate all potential threats.\n",
            "\n",
            "Ah, I just love this movie, slow pace and leaves nothing for your imagination (sometimes I don't like that about a film, but it works in this one). Can we just take a minute to appreciate Marlon Brando's role interpretation, I love the way he worked with the body language, his voice and acting calm. And same goes for Al Pacino, just amazing! I'm so glad I finally got to see this film. \n",
            "\n",
            "720 ) The Godfather is one of the very few films that doesn't have a single flaw. Seeing The Godfather for the first time was the most amazing movie experiences of my life. There's scenes that stay with you when the movies over, and you don't forget them. Everyone makes the mistake of calling this film a movie about crime. Its really a movie about family. The dialogue is just unbelievable. I've seen the movie at least 30, 40 times, and I'm still amazed at how perfect it is. The music, the acting, everything. People think that Citizen Kane is the greatest movie ever made...well, there's no way that ANYONE can think that Citizen Kane is more moving, and has a better storyline than The Godfather. The thing I find so amazing about The Godfather is how Michael (Al Pacino) changes throughout the movie. Its my opinion that this is the greatest movie ever made, and I doubt that anyone can watch this movie, and think I'm crazy. \n",
            "\n",
            "721 ) The Godfather is a film of undeniable triumph; everything from the set to the sound and lighting, the score to the amazing cast, is perfect and Francis Ford Coppola's vision does justice to Mario Puzo's stylish crime novel, with the author partnering with Coppola on the screenplay. The film is a masterpiece of acting and direction, with Coppola's influence clear, and the work of stars such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino and Robert Duvall centre-stage in a beautifully dark and corrupt tale of a powerful Italian crime family. Never has the Mafia been better depicted in cinema, and I opine never will it be again. \n",
            "\n",
            "722 ) I have to be honest - I first watched this at about 19 years old, and I did not like it much. I thought it was slow, and I missed a lot of the subtleties throughout the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "However, having watched it recently at 32, I am more appreciative of the slow-burn classic that this movie is. The acting is superb, and it feels like everything - even scenes, time periods that are left out of the movie - is intentional. The sequel makes this movie experience even better, as it once again makes you ponder the unknown gap between Part 1 and Part 2. Maybe that's addressed in the novels, I don't know.\n",
            "\n",
            "Furthermore, this movie is complete with an epic finale that still blows my mind. I get so sick of movies that have that 'Stephen King Fizzle' nowadays! \n",
            "\n",
            "723 ) The Godfather in my opinion is one of the best and well produced movie I've seen. I've seen it many times and it always feel like it's the first time watching. It's an excellent film to watch by yourself or with friends (movie night). You're certainly in for a treat if it's going to be your first time watching The Godfather. It's long and I suggest turning your phone off. It's just shy of 3 hours, but it's so good that it will feel like 10 minutes. \n",
            "\n",
            "724 ) Boi, settle in, i respect people's opinion when they say the godfather is overrated but how can you hate a movie that is so well made on all level the acting is above superb everyone does a great job especially the leading men Marlon Brando is spot on with body language voice and general acting, Al Pacino seems bad at first but once he does the shooting scene it goes uphill like very uphill the shooting scene is his best where his eyes tell the whole story its like he is Micheal Corleone at that moment Robert Duvall does great load acting along with James Caan and a lot of the other male characters. The directing is so spot on in my opinion the second best directed film Coppola strives for such realism you can see it in the scene with the dead horse the actor wasn't aware that there would be a dead head in his bed and the head is real from a real horse so is scream is so authentic. The opening scene and ending scenes has so much detail and symbolism that I can't even go into details. The pacing is f.....g amazing you never get bored even thou it's 3 hours long when ever you are close they hit you with a scene that just blow up and you are fully hooked again. The script is amazing a great story and so many quotable lines the story has so many twist and turn and the characters always feel real the dialogue is spot on delivering so much suspense and information so effectively. The Score it's probably the best score of all times I have never heard a score that fits the movie so perfectly and could also work effectively as normal music it delivers so much suspense and, the best pieces are the godfather waltz (the start) and the baptism these pieces deliver suspense information are are just great I sometimes start hearing these pieces in my head because they are so good. The cinematography is also some of the best of its kind the lighting conveys so much information and every scene is framed perfectly every scene could be a painting. And that is just some of the reasons why the godfather is one of the best film of all time and not overrated (I still respect your opinions). \n",
            "\n",
            "725 ) This is been excellent and favorite movie all the time. Mr. Francis done really a great in the history of cinematography. First opening scene has revealed the outstanding performance of Mr. Marlon Brando. Al Pacino was absolutely amazing in his young age. This movie set the dimension of a underworld trend setter movie. \n",

            "726 ) Such a script, scenario and acting, especially for that day and age this is a must seen movie.Apart from the culturistic lean towards this movie with the help of the trends, this movie is easily the best no matter from which angle you look.Gold piece.Stay nice & be humble, thanks for reading... \n",

            "\n",
            "729 ) Just the best movie of all time. Performances,dialogues,shots,camera work,sound, just everything is perfect about this movie. Marlon Brando's iconic performance as Don Vito Corleone a.k.a \"The Godfather\" is a gem to this world of cinema. Both The Godfather 1 and The Godfather 2 are equally good in my opinion but cannot say the same about The Godfather 3. \n",
            "\n",
            "730 ) From start to end, you are constantly reminded that you are watching one of the greatest movies ever made. The acting (especially Brando), the directing, the production design, and the cinematography are all top notch. It's long, gripping, thought-provoking - truly an epic in every form. \n",

            "\n",
            "732 ) While the plot of this movie is amazing, star cast is outstanding, cinematography and background music are masterpieces in themselves - the part which I like the most about this movie is how perfectly it depicts the influence of the cultural during those days over the society. The fine and minute details of lavishing lives of these underworld mafias, suppression of even elite women in almost every class of society and a lot more is put forth by this movie. The movie is full of twists and holds on to the audience. Your adrenaline level can be fairly high during these three and a half hours of your live. A must watch. \n",
            "\n",
            "733 ) Could it get any better than the Godfather? Classic film with iconic plot twists, incredible performances and an overall feeling of \"familia\"...no wonder it stands the test of time. The performers were at the top of their games in this one. Maybe they should make a modern- day follow up. I mean, they are remaking everything else. Why not? Need a writer? Let me know! :) \n",
            "\n",
            "734 ) Shows powerful men's life. Its not just a movie for quickies. careful watching gives you glimpses of handling creatures of emotion and fear. its not exaggerated. But it is generally applicable in civilized society when leaders have emerged. Another interesting thing is usage of sound. A lot of sound and scenes are composed without dialogues. Light, silhouette, symbols of shadows are heavily used to 'frame' godfather. even you can hear a lot of family sounds without meant for any literal communication to the audience. baby cry, Italian conversations.. Bit lengthy and dialogue oriented. Only watch when you have peaceful time. \n",
            "\n",
            "735 ) I'm not going to get into everything about the movie and give away spoilers. Instead i am just going to tell you that this movie is a masterpiece and a very realistic portrayal of the Italian Mafia and the crime underworld. And one of the best things to know about this movie, and the rise of Michael Corleone, is that The Godfather 2 is even better and shows the rise of Don Vito and The Corleone Family and at the same time it shows Michael becoming more powerful and expanding The Family to Las Vegas. The movie is like a prequel/sequel combination. I kind of went into part 2 a little more than i should of. To put it to an end, The Godfather is not only one of the best Mob movies ever made, it is one of the best of any kind of movie ever made. If i had to give a list of the top 5 movies ever, The Godfather 1 and 2 would be in that list, no doubt about it. \n",
            "\n",
            "736 ) The best movie in my view made in the 20th century, especially love the Don's line: \"I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse\". The actors, script, set design, costumes are all top notch and well worthy of the recognition provided by awarding of the Best Picture Oscar for 1972. MUST SEE. \n",
            "\n",
            "737 ) I like Mafia movies, I think Scarface and Goodfellas, two masterpiece, but The Godfather was never much of my taste, I find the movies very good, but not him and 2 are not movies that would speak that are better than the story , The initial scene of the film is excellent, has heavy moments, excellent dialogues, a very good script, the direction of Coppola is great, the truth is that Coppola is an excellent director, unfortunately he made more bad movies than good, the cast Is great, Al Pacino at the beginning of his movie boom, and Marlon Brando does one of the best performances of all time, from an excellent character that is Don Corleone, I think the film is very big, so the rhythm falls a little , The soundtrack is excellent, the photography is very good, The Godfather is an excellent film, even if I do not find a masterpiece, its quality and contribution to the cinema is undeniable. Note 8.7 \n",
            "\n",
            "738 ) It was very good.At the beginning it seems to be passion of heart and later transfigures into a drama Alfred Hitchcock tried to establish. Suspense and excitement, the old film noir and modern crime.Representing a journey that you will never forget. Mario puzos novel was greatly applied by Brando,Pacino and the whole cast.Likedit sincerely.Motivated me to be a film lover. \n",
            "\n",
            "739 ) This film is absolutely Brilliant in EVERY respect!! Characterization, Story, Plot, Script, Cinematography, Acting. The Godfather is a True cinematic Masterpiece. Bravo!If there are any holes, weaknesses or inconsistencies, I have yet to discover them. I've watched it at least 8-10 times and it blows me away every single viewing. GF2 was excellent, but not nearly as tightly written, several holes in the story that simply don't add it, but still a great film in it's own right. GF3 - very underrated indeed. \n",
            "\n",
            "740 ) The finest mafia film and the finest family i have ever watched. The craft of cinema is at its best in godfather series.Appropriately, the film is about a similar transition in organised crime, as the gentlemanly but sinister world of Don Vito (Brando) is eclipsed by the more brutal and expedient organisation represented by the doomed Sonny (Caan) and the calculating Michael (Pacino). \n",
            "\n",
            "741 ) The son of a Mafia boss returns from the war and following an attempt on his father's life becomes more and more embroiled in the shadowy world of organized crime. Francis Ford Coppola's classic gangster saga is the story of a criminal dynasty headed by Marlon Brando in one of his most iconic roles. Coppola's direction is deceptively simple in that he uses no gimmicks or stylistic tricks; he merely allows the story to unfold and lets the superb cast do their thing. Brando's mumbling family and loyalty obsessed don has since become part of popular culture folklore (along with the classic score) and all other accompanying performances are top notch, from James Caan's hot headed Santino to Robert Duval's purely business orientated adviser. But this film is really the story of Michael's transition from honest war hero to shadowy underworld figure, played by Al Pacino in his finest role. The pivotal scene in which his newborn godson is baptized while Michael himself, the newborn \"Godfather\", is baptized in blood is an all time great. This is the birth of the modern gangster film and with the possible exception of Goodfellas, it is still to be surpassed. \n",
            "\n",
            "742 ) Easily the best movie i have ever seen. It is just peferct, the entire movie made me speechless. Perfet acting, perfect writing and perfect directing. Al Pacino and Marlon Brando gave us some of the best acting of all time, along with the genius directing of Francis ford Coppola. An instant master piece. \n",
            "\n",
            "743 ) The film, the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, is one of the most accomplished film creations of all time. It is not only the montage of the same, also the plot, costume, interpretation of the actors, and the intrinsic message that contains. The film is timeless, it does not matter in the year that was made, because at any time is a reference of a well-done story and good cinema. The subject of the mafia always intrigues, everyone wants to know about it regardless of what they consider, whether it is good or bad, because they are well-planned organizations in which discipline, and respect for the word do functional. The godfather collects all these elements, jointly by the love for the family, and not only the family of the home, but family is the whole organization. This film must always be a paradigm of exquisite cinema. The godfather is one of the best films of all time.\n",

Alright, now that I have reviewed The Shawshank Redemption, it is time we go through the other greatest thing in cinematic history. That film... is the 1972 motion picture The Godfather. Not a kid- appropriate movie at all when you got a scene of a severed horse head and several brutal deaths but even then it is a masterpiece. FACT. You got one of the greatest casts ever in this masterpiece. Review of the second one coming soon but this is still amazing. \n",

It is one of the greatest crime mob stories ever told. \n",

This film is a timeless reminder to filmmakers that you don't need death-defying stunts and fast-paced actions to make a good gangster film.

This is a perfect 10 out of 10. \n",

With an exquisite cinematic direction making of the film an almost perfect semiotic and narrative composition. Francis Ford Coppola tells us the importance and honor of the Corleone family and its consequences of betrayal in business.

The acting is beyond refined and exceptional I could not fathom up to this day how they got that so natural and so out of this world actions immortalized to the screens by these outstanding actors and actresses of our generation. The director itself is not only a genius and clever one but a perfectionist that presents a movie with almost no single flaw creating a visually impacting, aesthetically appealing, technical excellence, epic storytelling, outstanding acting and exceptional film.

The lines are iconic, the scenes of family, betrayal and violence are all memorable, the performances are beyond Oscar worthy and it does what any great adaptation does; stay as faithful to the original as possible and only make changes whenever necessary. For me the most iconic scene is the baptism murders, which I fell are appropriately edited as Michael Corleone oversees the baptism of his infant son. The only minor nitpick I have is that, although Marlon Brando does give a solid performance, the look they gave him is a little too much like a geezer for me to believe he is a Mafia don. Nonetheless, this is a film that anyone taking a cinema class should watch. \n",
            "\n",
            "765 ) The Godfather is by far one the best films I have I ever seen. It is my favorite movie ever because of various reasons. The cinematography is exceptional. The dark atmosphere provides the viewer with a visual representation of the shadiness of the Corleone family. The directing and editing are beautiful, with scenes like the baptism killings and Michael's killing of Sollozzo and McCluskey showcasing this. The acting performances are fantastic, some of the best I have ever seen. Brando's performance as Don Vito Corleone left a mark on me after seeing it. Pacino, Duvall, Caan, Vigoda, and Castellano all portray their characters perfectly. There is not much else that can be said about how fantastic this movie is. It might be the greatest American film in history. If you have not seen The Godfather, watch it now. You are missing out. \n",

            "766 ) What else can be said. This classic movie is a must see for anyone interested in \"older\" films, \"classic\" films, and otherwise \"darn good\" films. The acting us superb. I have watched this film at least a dozen times over the years, and see something new every time.\n",

I have to say it never pays to have a hot head, and can't think right, as seen in some of these movies, but rather use your brain and then think out your strategies. \n",
            "\n",
            "768 ) I know many people do not care for this movie, however it quickly became one of my favorites. The actors gave these characters special meanings and helped to make the \"criminals\" more \"likable\" in my opinion. This movie is one of my \"go to\" choices when I am looking for something more familiar to watch and I honestly can view it every view days with no problem.

I love godfather, i can see it, maybe...maybe, 10x, maybe 15x and every time I look like child which get new toy. Music is one of the best ever (not just OST), camera is also brilliant, ALL actors are daring and stunning as director of this spectacle. And Fredo Corleone is adorable. Everyone, must see it, and when I say everyone, I mean everyone. 100%, 10/10, 5/5, 4/4 or how you want. Just...just WOW. Thank you to all the crew of the film, you are all worthy of an Oscar. \n",
            "\n",
            "770 ) It's a great movie but can get boring. If you hate dialogue i recommend not watching this movie. If you love it then of course by all means watch it.

            "Francis Ford Coppola cleverly insinuates an inherent evil in all his characters, weaving a sense of fear in the audience through every frame as he skilfully employs his overwhelming background score to amplify the significance of every transition. Marlon Brando is impeccable in his intimidating yet layered performance as the Don, but it is truly Al Pacino who heightens the picture as the viewer feasts on his electrifying rise from an innocent, patriotic soldier, to the head of the Corleone family.\n",

            "There are numerous thrilling set pieces throughout the film that resonate profoundly towards the audience through their eminent grandeur, such as the Baptism killings, the Sollozzo assassination and the brutal murder of Sonny. However, amongst these iconic scenes of visceral brilliance are the character arcs that truly touch the viewer, including Michael's subtle romance when taking refuge in Sicily, as the audience indulges in the glorious beauty of Italian culture, or even the domestic predicaments that Connie has to painfully bear, which the audience takes to heart.\n",

The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic. \n",

This will bolster the potential for the film which has an outstanding performance by Al Pacino and a strong characterization by Marlon Brando in title role. It also has excellent production values, flashes of excitement, and a well-picked cast. But it is also overlong at about 175 minutes (played without intermission), and occasionally confusing. While never so placid as to be boring, it is never so gripping as to be superior screen drama. This should not mar Paramount's b.o. expectations in any measure, though some filmgoers may be disappointed. \n",

The story that grows is simply one of the best that converts to cinema, the scenery, the era, the cast, all contribute to a stunning three part drama. Personally, Brando gives a master class in timing, delivery, to the extent we can all see, he is the boss, in this star studded film. I will leave you with this advice, please , watch it a few times, there are pieces of the film you will miss, it's only after reviewing it a few times will you pick up on the nuances that make this epic a stand out. \n",
            "\n",
            "782 ) This film is NOT a masterpiece. People are simply over hyping this movie because they know that Hollywood has no other films that are superior to this garbage. When it comes to the actors Marlon Brando, Al Pacino etc. It becomes obvious throughout the film that they are just actors and did not work that hard to make falseness look like reality. Their performances were terrible and almost ruined half the film for me. The dialogues were not even original. This film is not realistic. Marlon Brando looks like a coca doodle do. How are these characters even supposed to be gangsters when all they do is just kill other gangsters and help the poor and needy people? That's not the acting of a mafia don! Their performances were NOT believable whatsoever. I could tell that they were acting the whole entire time. Constipated looks on the faces of Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. This film is a joke! It's funny how everyone says Godfather (an average film at best) is the greatest film of all time but they don't even give any real reasons. What scenes of the film make it so great in the eyes of the audience? \n",

Father 1 and father 1 after father 2 in the movie before the father is a father of mafia tells the state. In 3, he tells about his father's life after himself. Alpacino is Alpacino in the film Baba is a film. After Dad's film, he's already taken the wounded face. But many people who know father film do not know wounded film. A wounded face is one of the films that can try a masterpiece among mafia movies in the movie. The point based on the film was the point of importance to the family. How much a man is a father of mafia, there is a family that should look after him. The Godfather, the leader of many mafia leaders, has also opened a new style among the mafia. The Carlin family, which determined an image that would never be destroyed, has entered into legendary films with the father film. The Godfather is adapted from the same book by Mario Puzo. In the film, we will observe the developments around an Italian mafia family living in America, and we will get to know them closely. Michael Corleone, the family's youngest son, who joined the army to get away from her business, who is opposed to her father, takes on the job she does not love to save them from the difficult situation her family falls into.

If you live like this and you are surround by Italians Mafia and very bad gays that want to kill you or other member of your family you will protect them at any cost.

            "For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.\n",
            "\n",
            "What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.\n",
            "\n",
            "What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. \n",
            "\n",
            "793 ) Classic movie with classic actors in which it cannot be missed. A movie that I grew up with and your children and grandchildren will as well. Not many movies are made in this way. Some try to replicate, but it cannot be done. A timeless classic that does not go out of style. A movie that may not be for the whole family, but eventually will. \n",
            "\n",
            "794 ) It's impossible not to like this movie. It's 'oldie, but goldie'. Such a good movie. And Marlon Brandon is one of the greatest actors ever. FF Coppola made a marvellous job in turning into a great movie the Mario Puzo's book. If you are a movie watcher, you have to see this. It'll mark you for life. \n",
            "\n",
            "795 ) First read the novel and then watch it . Both are fantastic . But I prefer the novel . Marlon Brando's best performance ever. Al Pacino was great . Coppola made it nicely .\n",
            "\n",
            "It is the best movie ever made in Hollywood . Probably the best movie on the previous century . It indicates how important can be a family bond . Vito Corleone's quotes - I gonna make him an offer he can't refuse made him more special to me . \n",

            "796 ) Every time I've seen that movie I only see him hitting her once... And it doesn't look like it was cut  Do not miss this film! The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? \n",
            "\n",
            "797 ) The worlds best movie. I simply love the story, the music, the acting, the casting, the filming, the dialog, the flow of the story line, the director, the editing. The audio commentary is also great fun. A 3 hour movie that feels much less. I have re-watched this movie 20 times and I'm far from done with it. \n",
            "\n",
            "798 ) This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable. \n",
            "\n",
            "799 ) My Personal Rating 10/10 - This film is an timeless classic masterpiece. The Acting the soundtrack the atmosphere the cinematography almost everything on this film is unbelievably perfect, i never saw anything like that in my history of watching movies. the more time you watch this movie the more you will love it, that's what i exactly did. This is my personal favorite movie yet, but it might not be a movie for everyone though. \n",
            "\n",
            "800 ) Copolla directed a film that holds you from the beginning to the end with the merits of the excellent work of Mario Puzo, and an excellent performance of almost everyone in the cast, especially Al Pacino and Marlon Brando. In my opinion is the best of the trilogy and a movie that should be on the list of those who haven't seen. \n",
            "\n",
            "801 ) An Example of Cult Classic,Simply A Mind Blower and An All Time Top Listed Movie. Al Pacino Was Amazing. The Whole Movie is One Hell of A Drama. The Whole time we looking forward to outcome. One of the Best Crime Dramas Ever. Screen Time of Every Actors were pitch perfect and The Script was just A Classic Script Itself. \n",
            "\n",
            "802 ) This is the movie that created the mobster genre. It took mob movies to an entirely new level of depth. Plot, dialogue, intrigue, all top notch to compliment the action. In addition the cast was legendary and all of them were at the top of their game. If you ever thought all mob movies are the same it is because they all copied The Godfather! \n",
            "\n",
            "803 ) See something new every time I see it.A right mixture of tragedy and comedy.Found a common love and appreciation everywhere screened. Characters and all of the different personalities caricatured in this movie lives among us.The cast is so popular and familiar which attached me to the cast very much as true to the life.Sounds, music, color and light in this film are just remarkable. The methodology followed in filming each frame is highly appreciated.Emotions conveyed in the film can be felt in depth by each one of the viewers clearly and at large.Who can rate this wonderful movie for which the a simple common rate card is not suffice. \n",
            "\n",
            "804 ) This is by far the best movie ever to give a portrait organized crime, this movie goes deep inside and shows it all inside out..\n",
            "\n",
            "With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business, for example their denial to step inside the narcotic business brings on a lot of troubles, but also it shows what kinda sacrifices they make, every day could be their last day..\n",
            "\n",
            "Al Pacino shines above all in this movie, as the smart boy of the family he returns after fighting a war for his country, at that time not involved in the family business, but it doesn't take long before the war breaks lose and he see no other ways than to step in and fight for his family.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is definitely a \"must see\" masterpiece. \n",
            "\n",
            "805 ) Honestly, I don't know a single respectable person who doesn't like this film. It is perfect from every angle and is enormously culturally significant.\n",
            "\n",
            "From the start when we are introduced to Don Vito, to the end where we see the conflicted Michael take control of the dark empire of his father, every scene is captured masterfully. With such a great cast including Al Pacino, James Caan, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton, with the ever masterful direction of Francis Ford Coppola, it is difficult to see this film ever failing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Not only performance and direction-wise, it follows the book very well, too. Sure, some subplots are deleted, but with an already immense running time of 3 hours, backgrounds of minor characters like Al Neri and Rocco Lampone will be missed, but accepted as non existent.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, this film is perfect. \n",
            "\n",
            "806 ) I have watched The Godfather so many times I'd be rich for every dollar viewed, that said, I cannot fault this cinematic masterpiece, that perfectly romanticizes organized crime. The characters develop especially Al Pacino's Michael, but all the actors have something to do and say and in a style that has today become synonymous with Coppola. The violence is stylized like a 1950s movie. The dialogue moves every scene forward. It breaks every rule by starting with a wedding and it works. Coppola has great fun with every scene, so evident in his use of family members, notably Talia Shire. Writing this has made me want to watch it again. Perfection! \n",
            "\n",
            "807 ) Well... if I had to choose the ultimate Gangsta movie to review this tops the list! Action..Crime..Suspense to name a few are all included in this flick, and it does not disappoint. This is your go-to movie when you want to feel like the ultimate CRIME BOSS (minus the jail time)Definitely one of Francis Ford Coppola best films. He really captures the essence of the lifestyle these Good fellas have. In retrospect he breathes life into the characters that already hold enough personality for an entire football team. If I had to rate it between one and ten I would say a seven, only because the movie is so damn dark you feel like the director shot the entire flick at night! \n",
            "\n",
            "808 ) I liked it a lot. It's truly a masterpiece. I thought he cast was well priced and he director did a phenomenal job at directing this film. I also think the sequel is as good as the first, if not better. If I could give this film more than 10 stars right now, I honestly would. I remember going with my boyfriend to see it, for it is his favorite film. He laughed and cried and wanted to see it again and again. I am the same exact way. I not only likes this movie, but I loved it, and I still do. Even now when I see a grandfather clock I always think of this movie. Actually, writing this review right now is giving me so many amazing and beautiful memories of the movie that I want to go and see it again. I would truly recommend see this movie as soon as possible. I'm sure you wouldn't regret it. It made me the person I am today. \n",
            "\n",
            "809 ) First time i saw this movie i did not understand the actual realty of movie and characters acting was speech less. Rest i can said when i saw and understand this movie after my 5th 100% successful attempt to watch full movie then i realize this was the awesome movie i need to buy original, and well be in my personal collection . Currently my family and my friends also buy the original blue ray of this movie very hard to find a seller because all want this one to their collection part.\n",
            "\n",
            "fabulous acting, superb story and played with characters am speechless. We all knows we well not again see to like this kind of level of movie in any decades hats off to all super actors in the movie. \n",
            "\n",
            "810 ) The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release.\n",
            "\n",
            "It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best. \n",
            "\n",
            "811 ) One of the best movies I have ever see, and I love it everything about this movie. Nothing in this movie is too much, every scene in the movie is perfect. The movie is with best cast ever, best directing, good story. It is about crime, family and their relationship. The best thing about it is that movie don't have any flaw. The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D \n",
            "\n",
            "812 ) Revolutions is much more concise and to the point than Reloaded was. The action is much more focused and purposeful, mostly because the movie is working its way toward a conclusion, rather than an open ending or a cliffhanger like either of the first two movies. The dialog is geared toward answering unanswered questions rather than raising new ones, and even the new questions raised in the third film can be answered by watching the film again (watch all three a few times over and you'll be as pointlessly knowledgeable about The Matrix universe as I am!).\n",
            "\n",
            "Unlike Reloaded, even the score fits well with every scene in the movie. I didn't care too much for the rave scene (the scene or the music) in Reloaded, but I can't recall a moment in Revolutions when any scene or sounds felt contrived or unnecessary. If nothing else, I was more disappointed that some scenes and characters didn't appear in the movie! For instance, the Merovingian and his goons were grossly underused in this film! Such an egotistical, maniacal character should be the focus of more attention than what he received in what is supposed to be the best movie of the trilogy.\n",
            "\n",
            "(One thing I must say to any viewers who criticize the film because it doesn't look real enough or doesn't feel right: you need to stop thinking like an illogical human and treat The Matrix like what it is: something that isn't real. It's science fiction, and much of the action takes place in a computer simulated dream world that is described as an imperfect simulation of the \"real world\". That is all.)\n",
            "\n",
            "I have been more involved in The Matrix than I have been in any other media phenomenon to hit pop culture, which means that it is simply, for whatever reason, the realization of an idea that works very well for me. The Wachowski brothers put together an excellent body of work with these films and accompanying works on various media -- so excellent, in fact, that I am easily distracted by discussion of The Matrix, both within the context of the story and above and beyond the story (symbolism, allegorical applications, etc.)\n",
            "\n",
            "My only complaints were that the Merovingian was grossly underused, the fate of the Twins and some other characters was not explained, and the Kid's triumphant \"The war is over!\" at the end was a bit premature, given what we had just watched for the last two hours.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, everyone should keep in mind that the machines have Neo's code, and whether Keanu Reeves comes back or not, his intellect may yet survive in the Matrix somehow... \n",
            "\n",
            "813 ) Initially, I was expecting the movie to be more plugged into the matrix than unplugged from it. After deciding to go back and see the movie a second time with that expectation already established, I watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I understood then that the movie really required to be primarily \"unplugged\" in order to make any type of sense at all and close the trilogy. It didn't hurt that the second viewing was on an IMAX, as well. The sound and effects were simply amazing once again, and in spite of all the negative reviews out there, I am satisfied with the trilogy as a whole. I look forward to adding the DVD to my collection; it will be well worth the investment that is required. \n",
            "\n",
            "814 ) What was the point of this trilogy? Why take the pill to begin with? What were they fighting for? In the end the free humans settle for survival, and trade slavery for the rest of humanity for their own survival. If \"peace\" is the most important thing, why start the fight? In the first movie they tell us that freedom is the most important thing--without it you aren't really alive. It's worth giving up your life in the matrix; it's worth living a life underground in sewers and caves; it's worth fighting and dying for. By the third movie freedom wasn't as important as any of that. Leave humanity in bondage to the machines. Leave the matrix running and leave the free people in their caves. Just give us peace.\n",
            "\n",
            "There was so much promise. Not only did the Wachowskis not meet that promise, they wimped out completely. \n",
            "\n",
            "815 ) After protesting for as long as I could, my brother convinced me to see the third installment of the Matrix trilogy, The Matrix Revolutions. I will begin by saying that I was a big fan of the first film, and was curious to see how the story would end. I went into the movie with as open a mind as I could, but after the first forty-five minutes I was just angry at how bad the movie really was.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was at this point that Neo was reunited with Trinity after being held by the \"Frenchman\" in a sort of limbo (in this case it was a white on white on white train station.) This story line was entirely useless, especially since the conflict was resolved and served no point in the rest of the movie, except to introduce a cute little girl who is a machine, a useless program going on to live with the Oracle. (I lie, this story-line also gave the Wachowski brothers an excuse to film both a bondage night club and Monica Belucci's ample cleavage.)\n",
            "\n",
            "The movie goes on from there building up tension and \"drama\" that leads up to the breaching of the last human city, Zion. Another thing I do not understand is why the humans want to be free? The Matrix is a much better place to live than the real world, which is dark and cold and only hospitable under the ground. The people here have reverted to a new religion and to wearing horrifically unflattering clothing. Why would they choose this life of constant turmoil and darkness over the life of at least supposed happiness in the matrix?\n",
            "\n",
            "The movie builds up to two climaxes, one involving Neo in the Machine City and another involving the rest of mankind in Zion. In the end there is a depressingly anti-climatic battle in Zion where lots of stuff blows up real good, and not one person shows a single emotion. It is as if the directors told each actor to choose an emotion and facial expression to go along with that emotion and to stick with it. Watch closely Morpheus and Trinity for an example of this.\n",
            "\n",
            "Neo ends up having to fight the billions of Agents Smiths that have taken over the Matrix. If he wins, there will be peace, if not Zion will be destroyed. Since it all comes down to this battle, then what was the point of the rest of the movie? Especially the drawn out battle scene that precedes the films second climax? It is enough to make a person mad.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the end Neo of course defeats Smith in a manner that made no sense to me or my brother. Peace is declared and the Matrix trilogy comes to the most infuriating happy ending ever in the history of movies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Earlier I said that I was a fan of the first film, that has all changed because of what the Matrix went on to become. With the first film, they made history, but with the second two the Wachowski's have committed murder. The special effects in the second two movies are not eve as impressive, especially in Revolutions (never before have I seen a more boring gun fight!) This movie is infuriating and poorly written with so/so special effects and some of the worst acting ever captured o film (Yes, I am including the Star Wars Prequels). Skip this movie, skip Reloaded and simply watch the Matrix on DVD. It is far better. \n",
            "\n",
            "816 ) Matrix Revolutions is a revolution of a movie and shows that the brothers wont stop at a half worked job. the attention to detail and cinematography of the real world makes you shocked at how much work was really put into this film. In my opinion no one will be able to match the hugeness of the matrix trilogy for a long time. a job well done and a movie definitely worth seeing, even if you didn't like the 2nd one. \n",
            "\n",
            "817 ) Going into this movie I had one wish: To leave feeling that it was a successful conclusion to a two-part film. Taking Reloaded/Revolutions as a single (very large) movie with an intermission is the best way to evaluate it. Viewed that way I think it succeeded. I thought Revolutions was the equal of Reloaded, yet I can see how many will think it failed. The ending gave us everything we needed to know, but did not show us all we wanted to see. I'm speaking of the last twenty minutes or so here. After a visually robust middle, in which I felt my eyes grow larger in their sockets more than once, the ending seemed like an anticlimax. It needed to be longer, and I would gladly have traded some of the fx flair used earlier to give the final part of the film it's justified due. It will be awhile before I can look at it more objectively (perhaps I'll have to wait to view the two parts as one on DVD). I only suggest now that anyone seeing it let it sink in completely before being too critical. \n",
            "\n",
            "818 ) This movie looks and sounds like the Wachowski Brothers abandoned it. It degenerates from their previous successes, like they were running out of ideas and decided to fall back to previous scenes and dialogue.\n",
            "\n",
            "The nowhere more apparent than in the script. I wanted to tally how many times the captain of the Hammer said \"He's out of his goddamn mind\". Or \"Perhaps it is best that it is not up to you\". The Wachowski Brothers really dropped the ball when writing this movie. They recycled so much dialogue from Reloaded becomes almost painful to hear. The cast itself seemed like they just stopped giving a damn. I groaned by the time Trinity's second monologue of the film rolled around.\n",
            "\n",
            "I have an opinion that it would have been better if Trinity had died in Reloaded. It would've been something to drive Neo towards victory, and given Morpheus something better to do than be ordered around by Niobe. The siege of Zion, while good independent of the series, was a mistake. Matrix-fans demand Matrix stuff, and most of the movie wasn't in the Matrix. The stuff that was in the Matrix, was disappointing. The gun-check room was a complete rip off of the lobby scene from the first movie. I was really looking forward to Neo and Smith's final battle. I anticipated the fight scene in Matrix history. What I got was Dragonball Z, the movie. It wasn't a true fight. It was two inhumanly tough guys kicking and punching each other to no apparent end. And the way they killed Neo, was a complete let down. You've given us a great character, at least give him a dignified death.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only redeeming quality of this movie were the special effects, which were near flawless. But really, this movie should have been thirty minutes shorter and a lot cooler. I think they should tied Neo's confrontation to the battle for Zion. Instead we can an ending of some more philosophical babble and a stupid kid saying the war is over. That irritated me to no end.\n",
            "\n",
            "One thing that must be noted, this is a Matrix movie. Or was. Instead they turned it into a bad hash of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Bible, and DBZ. People don't come to the movies to think, they come to be entertained, to relax, to blow off some steam and eat some bloody popcorn. I don't the spend the week studying, go to see an action movie on the weekend, and expect to new age Zen crap shoved down my throat.\n",
            "\n",
            "Wachowski Brothers, if you make any movies in the future, remember three things: 1) Don't loose sight of your core audience, 2)Don't turn an hour and a half action movie into a two and a half hour pseudo-philosophical action movie, 3)Hire new writers.\n",

            "819 ) \"The Matrix, Revolutions\" was not on the level with the original, this much is true. However, it was undoubtedly a large step in the right direction.\n",
            "\n",
            "To start with the most praise-worthy aspect of \"Revolutions\", being that of visuals. From a visual standpoint this movie was amazing, the CGI was unrivaled by anything that had ever come before it. The final battle between Smith and Neo easily places itself somewhere in my three favorite cinematic sequences of all time. And the battle between the machines and humans in Zion is also jaw-dropping. From a purely visual standpoint this movie is simply the best of three (which is boasting a lot since the free-way chase in the sub par \"Reloaded\" was quite the sight itself). The CGI is probably the best in any movie ever made, a notch above \"Reloaded\", which at times felt as though it were a video game, and worlds ahead of any of the recent Star War's movies.\n",
            "\n",
            "Another improvement that was made upon the previous installments of the series was the music. Gone are cheesy techno theme's and watered-down POD lyrics. Instead we get to feast upon more gospel and, dare I say, epic themed musical backgrounds. Epic, as it would turn out, is the word that could best describe the feel of this final Matrix chapter, the entire time you feel as though you are engaged in something epic and important.\n",
            "\n",
            "The acting is right back where it should have been in the second one, as all characters are portrayed better by their respective actors/actresses. Fishburne provides us with probably his strongest performance of the three, he is in a the role of a more emotional Morpheus then we have seen before. And it certainly turns out to be a role that he seems comfortable in. Reeves and Moss also both seem to be right back in their acting grooves (this is of course assuming Keanu ever had one). Also, Agent Smith definitely is the strongest character in this movie, the acting is right-on and the character is developed to completely new heights as true sadistic colors come out completely for the viewer to enjoy.\n",
            "\n",
            "The only complaints that can be made are about the over done philisophical conversations and the movie's open ended conclusion. \"Revolutions\" at times feels as though it is trying too hard to be intellectual. Impending death does not need to make everybody do their best Plato impersonations. And in the end you may feel as though the movie has left you as clueless as when the series first began... Then again, you may also feel as though you have figured it all out. But irregardless the future of The Matrix is left up in the air.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the end, \"Revolutions\" will be hated by some people and loved by others, there will be no gray here. It is hard not to measure it up to the first Matrix, which leaves it looking slightly wanting. However, it turns out to be thousands of times better then \"Reloaded\" (which I feel was a solid flick itself!) And one thing that the open ended conclusion does do for me, is fill me with hope that the journey down the rabbit hole is not yet over. \n",
            "\n",
            "820 ) The Matrix:Reloaded was good. Not as good as I would have liked, but good nevertheless. Revolutions was unfortunately many degrees below that standard. The feeling I got throughout the entire film was that the Wachowski's had the phrase \"wouldn't it be cool if...\" on their minds, and due to the success of the first film, nobody would stand up to them and say that, well, actually, it would be pretty cheesy. There are so many scenes that are just awful cliched nonsense. I hope that in ten years time, as happened with the Highlander series, somebody will come along and pretend that these original sequels never existed and create some new ones following on from the first film.\n",

Though the ending was different than i expected, it was far from refreshing. First of all, i didn't see the point of killing Trinity. It really gutted me to see her die, as she was my favorite character. They could have killed everyone else but Neo and Trinity and i would have been OK with it. So could anyone tell me what the Wachowski brothers might have been thinking when they killed her off? I was very disappointed by this final addition to the trilogy, and would much rather it had turned out different. From the moment Neo was blinded, dread crept into my heart and didn't leave. As the credits rolled on, i felt thoroughly depressed and amazed at the way the Wachowski brothers had decided to wrap up their amazing story. Could anyone help enlighten me on the reasons for their making it this way?? \n",

            "822 ) I see that I am not alone, other people were dissapointed with this pathetic,decidely tawdry attempt at a film. The first movie had the right aesthetic blend of visuals coupled with some interesting philosophical questioning. Matrix 3 Revolutions does not have a single bone of originality contained within its rather sad, scrawny little frame. Instead it is reduced to the self referential, with the same moves and same scenes from the original film being endlessly repeated. Transparently the film grafts off ideas from the Star Wars movie's in terms of not only themes - (the flight of the nebuchednezzar through the dimly lit tunnels of Zion will remind many film aficianados of the millenium falcon's journey through the Death Star in Return Of The Jedi) - but music, too. The hydraulically devised robotic suits that the defenders of Zion don to defend their city from the enemy are blatant derivatives of the loader mechanism used by Ripley in Alien. The action sequences are disparately littered throughout the course of this nearly three hour film, with the majority of its content being devoted to mind numbingly boring exchanges between Neo and Trinity, Neo and Oracle etc (you know the drill: dull, soporific dialogues along the lines of 'Ah, but Neo you know', 'ah, but I don't', 'but you do really'...just get to the f*****g point Oracle. If you know the answer just tell him!) Who did they hire to write this godawful mess, the scriptwriters of Sunset Beach?\n",

            "823 ) The first movie in The Matrix Trilogy is the best one but The Matrix Revolutions brings the first movie's feeling back again and does a great job in terms of story telling, special FX and also being unpredictable and surprising it's viewers.\n",

But, let's stop complaining, and on to the review (some spoilers ahead).\n",
            "\n",
            "Remember the cliffhanger which made all the nerds in the Internet to make up incredible and, sometimes, rather creative theories and explanations?, well, all the thing was just Neo trapped in a train station by the Gyro Captain of Mad Max 2. Yes. That was it. And this leads to yet another boring confrontation with the french dude from the last movie, which concludes with... Neo being freed. What's the impact of this subplot in the main story?. None. But it was a good way to resolve the cheap cliffhanger left by the last movie... good in monetary sense, I mean: it made all the fan boys return to watch the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, alas, then we have the actual plot of the movie, which is so stupid, it's hard to believe. Neo now wants to go to the \"source\". Why?, he doesn't know, but he goes anyway. The rest return to Zion, and we have to watch a battle sequence so boring, it's almost incredible: the characters in that sequence aren't developed at all. Why must we care for these guys?, good question.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, long story short, Neo goes to the source. He's blind now, but he \"sees everything\", because now it's time to rip off Dune, I guess. Trinity dies, he goes inside a city of machines, talks to a machine, he's plugged into some machine, and then he fights Agent Smith, which is ultra powerful now, for some reason. In the end, he's the victor, of sorts, and the machines stop their attack against Zion and retreat, leaving mankind still mostly enslaved by the machines, and living in a hole in the ground, but everyone is happy: Morpheus is crying of happiness, so I guess we must be happy also.\n",
            "\n",
            "This movie is so stupid and pretentious, it becomes unbearable to watch. For example, the \"I do this and that for LOVE\" is a recurrent theme, repeated by almost every character of the movie; yeah... that's subtle. You know what's another thing you can do to make it even more subtle?, maybe NOT MAKING EACH CHARACTER ON THE MOVIE REPEAT IT.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, at least, this movie had a good thing: it ended. Conclusion?, if you don't have a good story, please, don't make sequels to somewhat successful movies. All the hype, effects and pretentiousness can't replace a good story.\n",

            "825 ) Matrix 2 and 3 are to Matrix 1 exactly the same disaster as Highlander 2 and 3 to Highlander 1. I have only this theory: When the Wachowski Brothers did the Matrix, it was their first big budget movie and so they couldn't do what they want. The studio gave a mediocre script to a script doctor who rewrote the matrix into a superb modern action tale. And now, as the matrix was a blast, the wachowskis got totally creative freedom and now we know... they actually suck. Their executive producer or even Joel Silver personally would probably have done a better sequel.\n",

            "The key to understanding the Matrix films is to unpeel the onion; reveal the layers. I believe that you have to understand The Matrix before you watch Reloaded, and you have to understand (as best you can) Reloaded before watching Revolutions. Those who dismissed Reloaded after a cursory glance will certainly not be able to grasp the significance of the Revolutions.\n",
            "\n",
            "That said, it is certainly not a perfect film. Its weakest point is in the action rising toward the climax. There is a time, during the great battle, when we lose track of the hero's personal conflict. The epic battle between man and machine is extraordinary, and unlike certain scenes in Reloaded, it didn't seem to be about showing off, but there is a time where we lose the momentum of the protagonist's journey. Of course, it all ties together in the end, but when the audience has to work to connect the two plot threads, it weakens the payoff.\n",

            "The other problem that stood out was the introduction of \"Red Shirt\" characters in this film. (Fans of Star Trek know what I'm referring to.) These are the characters that are introduced for the sole purpose of performing an important action and then dying. However, I can't really fault the Wachowskis for this, because no one has ever figured out how to handle these characters.\n",

            "Ultimately, the Matrix Revolutions answers many of the questions the first two films raised, but fortunately, not all of them. It leaves some issues open for discussion, which shows that it's still possible to make a film in Hollywood without using a \"Hollywood Ending.\"\n",

The first one from the point of view of the humans in the matrix, the second one the point of view of the humans outside the matrix and the third one the real one and how it is. I like the ending cause it was unexpected and of course it didn't pleased the geek fans cause the geeks only think with one type of analisys not froma movie point of view too.

            "\n",
            "829 ) The Matrix Revolutions was was the highest anticipated trilogy finale behind Return of the King...and by the time that Revolutions rolled around, people had grown disappointed of Reloaded while others cherished the philosophy embellished sequel...I personally am one of the latter. Here is why I enjoyed Revolutions, and why I rated Revolutions an 8/10.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lets start with the acting...and a small but pertinent synopsis. Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo. Yes, Keanu Reeves is extraordinarily wooden for this role...but that is because he has to be. The character of Neo has lost everything by the time that the movie roles to a conclusion. Neo does not bear emotion after a certain loss during the course of the film, and the film concludes with Neo fighting himself. However, \"himself\" is represented by Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith. By the time that the two clash in arguably the greatest fight scene of 2003, Neo has lost everything and has no idea that it is simply his will pushing him forward. *small spoiler* Even that does not hold through to the end. While Neo has stripped himself of everything and every emotion, Agent Smith has grown exponentially more powerful and begins to show signs of anger, and even lust for more...something that his character lacked in the timespan of the first film or even the exposition of Smith in the second. Carrie Anne-Moss's Trinity, like Neo, has lost much faith in the war itself, but on the other hand, has gained so much faith for her significant other that she is willing to \"give anything and everything for him\". Carrie Anne-Moss is able to show that strong compassion for Neo without overkilling the role...this is a war mind you and its not wise to be on your knees telling your partner how much you care. Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is again the strongest and again, my favorite character in the film...although this time, his dialogue is no longer riddled with philosophical jabber and he has now been reduced to one of three captains trying to make his way home before it faces an untimely destruction.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now...speaking of which...we have the epic siege of Zion. A quarter million cephalopod-resembling machines are augering their way into the last free human domain...and what the audience is treated to is something that both blew us away...and at the same time, something that we expected with Reloaded's over-extended action scenes. What hurts the battle is that we lose touch with Neo and Trinity over the course of a quarter hour...which leaves the audience wondering two things when the story between the pair resumes (where are they and/or who cares). the battle does give us a little insight on some lesser elaborated characters...although not enough to make us like them or care for them. Captain Mifune and Kid are the two main battle-characters...but the female Zee and her rocket-wielding partner Charra are supporters. Some people may like this while others do not...the characters don't really matter during this battle...the battle matters.\n",
            "\n",
            "Lets talk about the battle itself. It was mentioned in the first, set up in the second and shoved in our face for the finale. I saw Revolutions twice on opening day, once in an IMAX theater and I must say, there were moments when the battle scene in Revolutions made me forget that I was holding my breath...something that the war in Return of the King didn't manage to do. The siege of Zion quickly becomes an exposion of live-action (very little) and CGI (13 of the 17 minutes) action where the humanistic machines of combustion engines and machine guns square off against the machinistic modules of doom that bear dozens of tentacles and lasers to boot. In a nutshell...I say that Return of the King had the best battle sequence of 2003...but only because Revolutions broke us in for it. Seeing two-hundred and fifty thousand squirming and swarming Sentinels against the seventy human-gunned walking tanks is a sight to behold. Wow, wow, wow.\n",
            "\n",
            "Now that the good things are aside (although I didn't make much mention to the final fight scene) lets talk about what hurts Revolutions the most. Its the poorly constructed script and the characterizations within them. Morpheus (as mentioned earlier) is no longer a philosophy-spouting genius but is simply a worried and frightened captain. Neo has somehow changed slightly from the falling action of Reloaded...he now knows the questions he needs to ask the Oracle, Trinity doesn't show the compassion that was felt in Reloaded...although her final scene did bring tears to my eyes, and the only character who we seem to know inside out from the last film and who has changed only because of what happened in the last film is the French Merovingian (who is my second favorite character). \"The prodigal child returns...are you here for the bounty, Seraph?\"...Agent Smith has the worst lines in the film when the excremental feces hits the fan for Neo, (\"I was standing here, right here...I'm supposed to say something.\"...yeah, something with a little more substance.) and the Trainman thing was a horrible waste of time that doesn't really tie into the last film at all...and the script really doesn't help it there. The Oracle is the only character besides Merovingian who brings continuity to this flick in terms of the script.\n",
            "\n",
            "As a trilogy, only Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are more epic in size and grandeur...as a pair of sequels...Reloaded and Revolutions are great but seem disconnected from the original somehow...as its own film...Revolutions deserves the 6.3 rating given to it by IMDb.com users...by I am judging it on how well its melds into and finishes this trilogy...which it does damn well. No one can be told what the Matrix trilogy is...they have to see it for themselves...and that is the only way to fully enjoy these three as a trilogy. It is the best seven hours you can spend watching science fiction. \n",

            "830 ) I liked the movie because there was more action than explaining comparing to Reloaded. I really liked dramatic scene where people of Zion fought against machines. Of course there's lot of philosophy to find other weird things for example how Neo killed Smith -program and how he can destroy machines easily in the real world. I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad when the movie doesn't explain some scenes for example how/why Seraph survived when he was with The Oracle. At least it gives freedom to figure it out by yourself.\n",

No, don't consider, know that to be the case! This remember is half of a 4 1/2 hour movie, so put Reloaded and revolutions together, you get one story narrative, add Matrix to the front of that, you get over six hours of action, story and drama, all ending in a big action packed final.\n",

No, that is not the driving force of these trilogies, but it is too end the war against the machines! We find out that Smith is Neos negative, created by the matrix to balance the equation of the programming. We find out why neo stopped those Sentinals mid air, he had touched the source when he was with the Architect and is now connected with the machine systems! What more do you want.

I found that romantic gestures and apparent lines of sincerity were so unbelievable that I spent half of the film giggling! This film lacked the ingenuity and breakthrough qualities of the original Matrix leaving it simply an action film rather than continuing with its ability to mentally stimulate the audience. The films ending was given away prematurely by the Oracle's hint to Neo, as an audience we want to think for ourselves, for example,did they really need to say that agent Smith is Neo's opposite?

As entertaining as it was it leaves the viewer with unanswered question as the first two did but in a whole different sense. The film certainly puts to rest the rumors that Zion city was part of the matrix. It also has a climactic ending for the future of the city and the battle between Neo and Agent Smith BUT WHAT BECOMES OF NEO???

            "\n",
            "All in all it was a good movie but it leaves too many questions with infinite answers we shouldn't be stuck pondering. Quite simply the answers are boring to imagine with the gaping wound of an ending we are left to close. I myself would bet even if it's not for 5 years there just may be ONE final installment. This films plot was simple, the storyline simple and the ending was also very very simple. There was less explanation of things and the films primary action was the battle with the robots. Not a lot of hyped up Kung-Fu fights in this flick. Anyone satisfied by this movie as the final installment has low standards and wasn't expecting or asking for much at all for their dollar. That's quite sad really. Synapsis: dull storyline, great action and the thinnest plot of all three movies. I very much enjoyed it but was left feeling unsettled by the ending and yes some what disappointed. \n",
            "\n",

What's worse is that one of the expected surprises didn't materialize, leaving a key question unanswered. Still, it did actually advance the story, with some suspense and definitely great special effects, so I gave it a 7, just barely.

            "837 ) We all know the first Matrix was spectacular. The second was ok, since the final movie was going to be earth shattering. Unfortunately, Revolutions had no great twist, and nothing happened that was unexpected. A friend of mine and I have a bet, which trilogy would be better: Matrix or Lord of the Rings.

            "After seeing reloaded I remember coming on here and hearing all the same comments about \"what were they thinking???\". That movie had long unending fights and went on interminably to finally add some spice with the whole architect thing. All you sceptics thought it sucked until most of you started blabbing your mouths off about \"matrix within the matrix\"... you made up that stuff yourselves and I don't know who started it, but you all bit and started fighting that line when it was clear that that wasn't so from the first time I saw the movie.\n",

I'd dare say that this movie might have gotten much MUCH better critique than it's getting here if it had been a movie unto it's own, or if all 3 had been in the same tone, maybe like The Lord of the Rings although it comes off more like star wars. On it's own it's a good movie with amazing and 100% believeable SFX, in the context of the other 2, it's a departure and that I believe made all the matrix fans mad, but the wachowskis hit the nail on the head with a fitting if somewhat annoying ending.\n",

The Wachowski brothers don't waste time showing what occurs afterwards, they simply end the story, telling it the way they wanted to tell it. This is one of the things I really like about the brothers, they don't sell out on their vision and let the film-making norms taking over their story. They tell their story, not the story that the audience EXPECTS or WANTS to see, but the story THEY want to tell, which is what film-making is really about.\n",

I watched it the other day, and thought that the main reason that people didn't like it was that it wasn't fully explained. Did Trinity die, did Neo die, what happened to everybody in the end, who cares! Can't you people see that the Wachowski's want people to make it up for themselves. I think that it's a really good way to end the series. It's a great way to end the series. The Neo/Smith fight was probably the coolest fight in the entire series. I thought the whole Bane/train station subplot were good. I thought that the entire movie was pretty gripping, and the entire battle for Zion was great. The only thing I didn't like really like was that they didn't go into the Matrix as much. It was only the opening with the train station bit, and the final Smith battle. I liked this movie. It wasn't as horrible as everybody else says. I liked it a lot. So, if you saw the first two and like them, then see this one. Don't expect it to be as good as the first two, but you will like it. I know you will. \n",

High expectations may have not been met; but the story line is surely wrapped up to the satisfaction of the MATRIX cultish following. Neo(Keanu Reeves)finds himself trapped between the \"real\" world and the computer-generated Matrix. Neo must put together riddles from the Oracle(Mary Alice)in order to strike a bargain with Agent Smith(Hugo Weaving)in the machine city to save Zion from obliteration. Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne)come to Neo's aid as a battle rages with swarms of tentacled mechanical sentinels. The grand finale is Neo's final confrontation in a driving rain with numerous Agent Smiths. Strong forward momentum from beginning to end. Adrenaline pumps at a fever pitch throughout this CGI spectacle. Also appearing in this explosive epic: Jada Pinkett Smith, Nona Gaye, Zeke Castelli, Nathaniel Lees and Monica Bellucci. \n",

            "843 ) I saw the movie last Saturday, and I've been trying to decide what i thought about it ever since then. Everyone came out of our theatre with a \"Ho-hum\" look on their face. This was not the \"balls-to-the-wall\" action film we all envisioned. I know it's certainly not what I expected. Therefore I am totally torn on my feelings for the film. On one hand I thought it was cool way to end the series, on the other hand, it seems there is so much more that could have been done to make this a better movie. There is no clear ending here, I won't give it away, but those who have seen it know what I'm talking about. We're just supposed to accept that some things happened after the end of the film, and in my opinion that boils down to bad filmmaking. Then I start wondering if it was intentional. The Matrix movies have always been about thinking and elusive meanings and dialogue, but it still seems that there should have been some attempt at a true ending. Now to the fights, these are spectacular. Spectacular, other than the first fight with Morpheus, Trinity, and Seraph against the Merovingian's goons which seems to me like a rehash of the lobby scene in the first movie, but then we get to the good stuff. The Zion dock fight is a new step in the right direction for CG mixed with live action, this thing is a beauty to behold and one of the best parts of the film. The superfight at the end is astonishing as well, as we finally see the two most powerful characters in the Matrix mythos go at each other like there's no tomorrow. Agent Smith is now totally enshrined as my favorite character of the entire trilogy, and he ranks up there with Darth Vader as one of my favorite villains in film history. Hugo Weaving shines here, and I hope will get some much deserved credit for his portrayal of Smith. The movie though is a totally mixed bag; it's better than Reloaded but not as good as the original which set the bar so high that it's hard to surpass. It will definitely take multiple viewings to sort all of this out and decide just how this film was meant to work. There's way too much to think about here. I think that if people give it a second chance and not just dismiss it after the initial viewing they will find more to love here, but only time will tell. \n",

            "847 ) Its been expected that many people would not appreciate the Matrix Revolution. The series doesn't throw every answer in your face, therefore its probably the only major budget trilogy that requires lots of thinking to understand fully. People don't really expect this sort of thing from a big budgeted, much anticipated movie, and they hype it so much, expecting the movie to turn out the way they *expect* it to be. Then when the movie takes a different approach to what people expect, then people don't like it. Its not because of the movie that people say it sucks, its because of the people themselves. Its their expectations that cause it. Instead of having expectations, I accepted the storyline as it was told, and any elements of the story that people dismissed as \"loose ends that weren't tied up\" are explainable if you put some thought into it and keep an open mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "Anyway, onto my review. Revolutions is an awesome movie that definitely takes a very different approach and has a very different feel. The first matrix was about awakening, and there was a balance of scenes in the real and matrix world. Reloaded took place mostly in the matrix, because its more or less the episode where Neo sets out on his prophesized purpose. Revolutions takes place mostly in the real world, where the events that happen in Reloaded force the humans to take up their last stand and just have a lot of faith. Just because Revolutions is not like the Matrix doesn't mean its bad, it just means its different. The movie has less talkative than Reloaded, but it still gets its message across. The action is simply over the top and very pleasing to the eye, with scenes like the super brawl where Neo and Smith fight in what I can only describe as one of the most outrageous and compelling fights ever. While this fight is not as lightning fast and complex as the Burly Brawl, it defintely has a very epic feel to it, with punches and kicks being magnified and Neo and Smith made to look like two gods in human bodies in a grand showdown. I said in my Reloaded review that it didn't hold back its creativity. Revolutions simply unleashes every ounce of it. The zion battle, because it takes place in the real world, does not feature any humans flying or doing fantastic feats, therefore it has a more down to earth feel. Still, it is probably the most intricate and overwhelming science fiction war scene, with, I can tell you right now, MILLIONS of sentinals flying around while the humans fight a desperate battle to hold them back. Let me tell you, if you don't think to yourself \"oh sh**\" when you see the giant swarms of sentinals, you're either too arrogant for your own good or there's something wrong with your head. The opening club shootout, as much as it was short, was awesome. It definitely makes the lobby scene in the first matrix look average, as it has people flying around, walking on the walls, and of course, shooting. All this to tune of an awesome techno rhythm. The action scenes in Revolutions, like Reloaded, are too excellent for words and definitely transcend any action scene filmed in any other movie in terms of creativity and coolness.\n",
            "\n",
            "That takes care of the action. Now the story. The story here is definitely darker and has more despair. As you will come to realize, the movie brings forth the Matrix Trilogy's christian elements. One such element is the whole idea of faith. Despite having an army of sentinals coming at them, despite Neo not stopping them before they reach Zion, and despite how nobody knows what they can do other than fight a losing battle, it is ultimately faith that pushes Neo to do something about it, and it is faith that allows the people of zion to have the courage to fight. Probably the most contraversial thing about the Matrix Trilogy, now that it is concluded, is the ending. SPOILERS... At the end, Neo fools smith into copying him, but what smith doesn't realize is that Neo, as the oracle explained, is essentially neo, except they're the yin and yang of each other. In order for one to exist, so must the other. Thus, when Neo is copied, and ceases to exist, the balance is gone and so is Smith. I thought that idea was genius. I didn't get it at first, but like I said earlier, I thought about it, and all was explained. After that, the machines stick to their end of the bargain, and really do, this time, give them a choice, and stop attacking them. The humans and machines live in the same world, and while the machines still exist, they are neutral to the humans instead of hostile. This ending, I thought, was perfect. It brings about the Yin Yang idea present with Neo and Smith. Also, if the film ended with the humans winning everything, the sun clearing up and so on, people will say it was too happy. If it ended with a downright bad ending, that would have eliminated the whole point of the movies. So whats wrong with something thats in the middle? This sort of ending was perfect and is also different, because not a lot of movies end like this, where the good guys and bad guys stop fighting and simply live out their lives independently, instead of one destroying the other. I suppose some people are asking 'why would the machines stop attacking? Now that neo's dead, why don't they just forget about the whole deal and destroy zion?\" The answer is very easy. As the architect put it, \"What do you think I am, human?\"\n",
            "\n",
            "All in all the Matrix is a great trilogy. People who didn't understand the film and refuse to think about the ending will complain endlessly and dismiss it as typical hollywood trash, but in my opinion I doubt there's ever been a major budget, hugely publicized trilogy thats had such a complex, intricate story, over the top action, and overflowing creativity. It is a terrific way to end the Matrix movies, but trust me, the story will not stop there. I gladly give this a 10/10. \n",

I indeed say that the action was impressive but the 2nd and this one does not have much realistic 3-D as the 1st one. Again there was not much of a story either. If this had a story like the 1st one, it would've been probably as successful. When the sentinels were attacking Zion was a cool scene and when Neo was fighting Agent Smith for the last time it was indeed cool too. I did enjoy it though but I honestly think this could've been a lot better and I shouldn't of been that anticipated in excitement of seeing this.\n",

            "850 ) The trilogy concludes in this film, coming out only a few months after part 2 hit theatres with a thud. As for the concluding chapter, it's hard to review without revealing spoilers.. but it was at least better than the dreadfull part 2. Now the first half hour - 45 minutes of this one is dreadfully borring and similar to what was wrong with \"Reloaded\".. leaden dialouge, lack of story momentum..etc.. However the mid-section of the film, featuring the battle for Zion was terrific.. very exciting action sequence that woke me up and kept me interested for most of the rest of the movie. Alass, the climatic showdown with Smith at the end was a bit of a letdown in that it was abunch of supposedly cool fx shots with no emotional weight to them.. and the actual ending of the film just was such a \"what the heck\" moment that it really left you wondering what the whole point was. Keanu Reeves is the lead character again, but he remains unable to deliver a convincing line read, and much of his dialouge, especially at the ending, is incredibly corny. Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishbourne in this chapter get left pretty much on the sidelines and dont get to do much.. the visuals take center stage in this chapter.. though Jada Pinkett Smith is the only supporting player to come off pretty good. On the whole, it was a hit and miss affair that is an improvement over the inept part 2 but nowhere near as good as the original. Still, for technical merit, and the one terrific fight scene, I'll give it a decent grade here. GRADE: B+ \n",
            "\n",
            "851 ) Expecting to have the ending you want will leave you disappointed. Yet if you go in with the mind set expecting nothing then you will have a good time. The reason this movie was made because there was the first movie that took psychology and computer class with a dab of Japanese animation and made you want more well more less this has been the same thing through out trilogy. So this a movie that follows the same lines so don't get disappointed when you go and see it. \n",
            "\n",
            "852 ) The special effects and action of this movie doesn't even up with the second, and of course doesn't approach the groundbreaking level of the first. But the action sequences are still intense and fun to watch, especially the final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith.\n",
            "\n",
            "This movie actually requires you to listen to the dialogue like the second one, which seemed to disappoint all the 12 year-olds in the screening I went to. The movie brings together all the elements of choice, good and evil(ying and yang), and the differences and similarities between human emotions and machine functions. All in all I think this third installment of the Matrix series really has a satisfying finish, even if it was less visually dazzling. \n",
            "\n",
            "853 ) you know, it is understandable to see why many were unsatisfied with the final installment of the matrix trilogy. my only complaint b eing is that this movie was just a continuation of reloaded and enter the matrix. however, is that a bad thing? if anything one could admire the boldness of a movie not following the typical Hollywood pattern of trilogy. that principle being that each movie has to have a wide stream of circumstances to complete that movie; when in fact this movie simply gave us a wide barrage of action and a subtle conclusion. i think that is why many were disappointed with it. to see our hero neo have such a simple demise rather than a strong, hardcore, and victorious defeat. the actual ending though confusing was appropriate as well. and to all of the viewers who were annoyed by the intricate dialouge of the movie, i have to ask why would you be surprised at this. i know it must suck to have to watch a movie or scene over and over to fully understand a part. but ask yourself this, how many times did you have to watch the first movie to get a clear and concise understanding of that world. for those who were upset that the majority of fighting took place in the real world rather than the matrix...........SO WHAT!!! i for one was pleased that the fighting was happening here as opposed to the matrix. why, because these characters fight so hard in the matrix, it was nice to see the world that these people were fight so valiantly to protect. notto mention that there was a terrific final fight in the super burly brawl between neo and his nemesis agent smith. i could give many other retorts to problems but that would be pointless. i can only say that i would suggest this movie to anyone and would also protest that this is a phenomenal ending to such a pivotal trilogy. 8 out of 10 stars!!! \n",
            "\n",
            "854 ) The Matrix Revolutions marked a sorry end for one of, certainly at the beginning, the most creative; most original science fiction films running on a smart premise we'd seen for some time. Where smarts; intelligence and well drawn nightmarish worlds complete with engaging ideas to do with life, existence, the universe and everything was once the predominant item on the menu, all has given way in the second Matrix sequel to flurries of \"What on EARTH!?\" moments; uninvolving love stories and dull causality culminating in a stupefying Tekken inspired fight sequence between two characters. The Wachowski's ideas featured in 1999's The Matrix were reigned in; they were kept in check, never feeling as if they were bigger than the project itself and explored in a dramatic and thoroughly substantial manner. The Matrix Revolutions appears tired with its origins, bored even; like the cleverest student in the class whom sits at the back just not feeling up to it on the day of the big exam, and falling just a little short of the pass mark when so much more was expected of them.\n",
            "\n",
            "As the piece crawled towards the end of its one hundred and twenty five odd minute run time, nearly all sense of immersement and respect for the trilogy was on the way out of the window, and I was praying their God-like Architect character would simply walk onto the screen, turn to the camera, hold up a remote control of some kind and just press a button that would make the screen go black. \"Now, we are finished.......\" he would bellow in a gruff, low, robotic tone. What we get is something just as stupid, but less amusing. Revolutions is the point The Matrix ceases to be a science fiction film about ideas complete with an initial, original vision; now rendered a dorky war-come-action film which pastes on a dull love story or two involving the leads and their supporting acts so as to try and insert a bit of heart into proceedings, amidst the gradually less and less interesting teenage orientated spectacle.\n",
            "\n",
            "The war between man and machine has reached its crescendo, the ultimate showdown between flesh and blood and metal and A.I. has arrived after burning at the back on a hob throughout 2003's other Matrix sequel entitled Reloaded. The eponymous hero of this now chore of a franchise, Neo (Reeves), is stuck in a strange zone of purgatory masquerading as a subway station and cannot get out to aid in the overall struggle. His mentor, love interest and cohorts in the form of the usual suspects Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity (Moss) skulk around looking for him as all sorts of different parties, in the form of programmes trussed up in human-being form, knock back nonsense banter about whatever self indulgent; self gratifying themes and subjects the Wachowski's feel they need to instill into the film. One trip to an underground fetishistic themed nightclub contains a fight sequence with guns complete with a stunt that reminded me of the finale to 2001's 3000 Miles to Graceland, the instance in which a guy comes spinning into view from the ceiling with dual machine guns blazing - not a good thing. Having taken two whole films to establish guns are useless in this universe, and pose little threat to those whom fight, it's a wonder the characters still proceed in using them. But it's all spectacle, and most probably acted as good trailer fodder.\n",
            "\n",
            "There doesn't seem to be much in the way of spine to Revolutions, people flit and hop from incident to incident without much clarity nor apparent reason. One is left persistently wondering where most of the supporting acts stand in their stance on the war overall, the film's complete lack of a hierarchy in this world full of sides, warring existences and clashing ideologies exposing the film-makers' inability to go 'better' after having already gone 'bigger'. Where does a Frenchman and his girlfriend, of whom he seems to have forgiven for her betrayal in the last film, stand? What about the creator and aforementioned God-like character The Architect? Where does he fit into rouge Agent Smith's plans, as an army of machines and their tank equivalents named Sentinels brood in their bid to destroy the human city of Zion. Does any of it matter if The Architect is able to reset everything and play God - does it matter if Zion is annihilated? Nearer the very end, a middle age black woman named The Oracle mopes her way onto screen after some prior interactions with an array of people; where did she fit into all of this and whose side was she on? Whom outranks whom? What does the train driver think of everything? Something may be grossly at stake, but none of it actually matters.\n",

            "Further pain is inflicted onto the audience during the 'big showdown', a massive fight sequence between the mechanical equivalents of a large spider hybridised with a wasp and named Sentinels with the ground troops of the humans in Zion. Here, the film's shortcomings become grossly apparent in that archetypal mannequins in a young soldier out to prove himself; a General, whom comes complete with a Braveheart inspired speech to rally the troops, and the non-soldiers in the form of two women whom feel the need to take the fight to the enemy, systematically allowing the makers to make it look as if they're addressing the issue of female empowerment amidst this war-zone, begin to take over as central to providing us with human characters as the spectacle moves in. Agonisingly, amidst the millions of people in Zion at the end, it's the General and the grunt whom just happened to bump into one another. Small incidences like that only fuel the feeling of the film's robotic, metallic and dulling temperament; where once was freshness and excitement is now occupied by the droll and incidental, and it sure is relieving to know it's all over. \n",

            "859 ) When I first saw this film back in Novemeber 2003, I expected more of the same from what I saw of the two previous installments...and I would have been very happy. But not completely satisfied. Then I went into this film, I sat through it and had an experience I have never had before (and most likely never will again). I was on the edge of my seat for the full runtime. Emotions I'd felt could not be put into words and when it finally ended I didn't know what to make of it. As I made my way home I could not stop thinking about what I had just witnessed. What was the purpose of this film? All sorts of ideas filled my head and I came to one final realization; The purpose was purpose itself. It exists to embody every thought and emotion we feel as we make our way through life. All our philosophical ponderings and revelations crammed into one brilliant trilogy. Obviously portrayed through extremes for entertainment value. But none the less concluded in supreme fashion. This is a modern classic. An achievement for the ages and a grossly under-rated flick. Best viewed with it's prequels in one sitting, the matrix trilogy is the most spectacular film saga I've ever come across. Depriving yourself of it would be a true loss.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even if you somehow miss the multiple messages and themes explored in this gem then you must take note of it's amazing special FX (which only help to emphasize the story and enhance the experience) and breathtaking visuals/direction. The acting is solid, and in some parts excellent. Hugo Weaving and Keanu Reeves both give great performances in this one. Morpheus is somewhat toned down compared to his previous performances (most notably in the first film). However with the misuse of Morpheus aside, the film is perfection in my eyes. What critics and people need to realize is that this film is not typical Hollywood film-making, it's something so much more. And it can only be appreciated if it is viewed through the eyes of someone who is willing to be more open, accept a wide array of themes and focus on the bigger picture, not minor flaws, which often blur your perception of the film. Take it for what it is, a great achievement in it's own right and definitely a landmark in film history. Highly recommended. \n",

            "860 ) Upon first leaving the theater, i was disappointed in the final installment of the Matrix trilogy. As I started to read up on it, however, I realized it made perfect sense to end it the way they did. I don't like writing spoilers, so i'll avoid that. I'll just say don't judge it right away. Let the whole trilogy sink in and it will all make perfect sense. The fight scenes are just as good as ever, but the battle on Zion was a little long and sometimes repetitive. It did feature some great action, though. There are plenty of tense moments and some unforeseen events that will catch you off guard. Hugo Weaving does the best job and plays the coolest character in the entire trilogy in Agent Smith and his many, many clones. This movie is very good but the original Matrix is still my favorite. If you didn't like Reloaded, you probably won't like this one. I think it is a well made trilogy and one that should be seen, because as soon as you understand it, the Matrix has you. 7/10 \n",

Won't that man ever give up? He goes to great lengths of upgrading himself and making duplicates by a deadly touch. Oracle, the wise one is always the toughest next to Morpheus and Neo. And who would have thought than Smith would take over Bane's body. Pure puppetry! And Neo enhanced his other power replaces his eyes when he fought the guy he thought was Bane. The machines in the movie were intense enough to stop a horde of those \"locusts\" that would damage the ports, and Neo himself would have to defeat Smith once and for all from within. Smith: THE VIRUS! Neo: THE ANTIVIRUS! He couldn't save his love the second time around, but he was able to save the world at the cost of his life. He was definitely a hero at the end. When he will be seen? Only time will tell. Rating 3 out of 5 stars! \n",

Whether or not you are a fan of the Matrix series the most important attribute to Revolutions is being able to understand it. No doubt the effects, albeit stunning, cannot save the Matrix, as we learned in Reloaded. This time around the acting and dialog was infinitely better, however, even these redeeming factors don't fill the gap completely. I loved this film, more than previous two - and is one of my favorites of all time, for that matter - but it's mostly accredited to the fact that I understand what happened in Revolutions. I'm not out to spoil it for anyone, but I have met more than enough of others who have seen this film and don't understand it, as well as do, to see that those who find Revolutions to be nothing but enigmatic hate the film more than all of the three. Consequently, those who have a grasp on what happened enjoyed the experience as much as I did and feel the same way I do.\n",

And once you understand the film, you get to love the rest of it: the action, the characters, the story, even more. 9/10 \n",
            "\n",

After viewing, I realized that I missed the wrong Matrix film to skip for a long period of time.\n",
            "\n",
            "Whereas \"Revolutions\" does not come close to the first film in duplicating the originality of the idea, it superbly triumphs the sub-par second film by eliminating much of the philosophical mumbo-jumbo and instead focus on a plot that the average viewer has a chance to understand.\n",

The special effects in the war scenes are pretty incredible...not anything we haven't seen before, but not even as close to as faky as those in \"Reloaded\". The other plot line sees Neo and Trinity traveling deep into the heart of Machine City, where Neo ultimately has his final confrontation with the seemingly unstoppable Agent Smith. That final showdown is so intense (and so awaited) that it will raise the hairs on the back of your neck!\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, then, this film falls somewhere in between the originality of the first installment of the trilogy and the over-the-top sequel.

            "867 ) 'The Matrix' is a genre and film milestone, while it is not one of my all-time favourite films it is still a great, impeccably made and awe-inspiring film and ground-breaking in its visuals and sound that broke boundaries in a way rarely if ever done before.\n",
            "\n",
            "In 2003, 'The Matrix' boasted two sequels, 'The Matrix Reloaded' and 'The Matrix Revolutions', generally considered critically and to audience not a patch in quality (though more mixed reviews than negatively received). To me, both are vastly inferior and have major problems. At the same time, neither are travesties, there are notable good points.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hard to say which is the better of the two sequels, they both have similar strengths but also similar flaws with a couple of things done better or worse in the other.

            "\n",
            "Starting with 'The Matrix Revolutions' good things, the film while not as imaginative as the previous film or as ground-breaking as the original still looks great.

There is an epic eeriness to the music score.\n",
            "\n",
            "While not as astonishing as previously and there is a slight overload of them (with a couple overlong), the action scenes are still very impressive and the awe factor is still there.

The final battle between Neo and Smith have garnered a mixed reaction, to me it was thrilling stuff and spectacular in mood even if ending on an anti-climactic note.\n",

            "Dialogue was not a strong suit in 'Reloaded' but it's amplified here, its endlessly and annoyingly cryptic conversations, over-wordiness, over-complicated long sentences and wallowing self-importance add to its increasingly cheesy and stilted feel.\n",

            "868 ) Like many have stated and has been widely considered, the Matrix film is a classic and has been spawn on and praised for generations. Then comes the Matrix Reloaded which was not quite at the level of the original, but that was expected seeing as how great and game- changing the original was. Though Reloaded is still entertaining and there is enough to like about this film, it continues the great relationships with Neo and Trinity and we still have the same great concept. Now within the third installment and conclusion of the series The Matrix Revolutions, this film has been criticized throughout and one can see why. The film as a whole is disappointing because it does not feel as a typical Matrix film compared to the previous two. Revolutions feels more of a bland video game based film or another completely different type bland action film.\n",
            "\n",
            "In the Matrix Revolutions, what is disappointing is knowing it's the finale of the series, and this is what the directors and writers came up with. There are some okay scenes but this film felt a little more mainstream and family friendly. Another reason why Revolutions is hated is because Neo isn't as focused in this film compared to the previous two. There is far too much time on the other minor characters and in the Zion levels. They simply aren't interesting and we do not care much about them. When we get to those scenes, this film drastically shifts and feels like a video game or action monster type film- and that is not what the Matrix is about. The previous two (specifically the original) were clever, suspenseful and made the viewers on their toes. In Revolutions, the suspense and build up is gone.\n",
            "\n",
            "The final showdown scene with Neo and Agent Smith was decent for what it was, as it was well directed and the special effects are brought in nicely. Though it feels almost bland in a way that this was the pay- off for the entire film. We all knew Neo was going to win, as the fight was well but rather predictable. Overall, the Matrix Revolutions is a disappointment and a sad mess. \n",

            "869 ) The action of this film is explosive and titanic and the soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in an action movie. The soundtrack (expecionally in the Credits) is titanic, colossal and unique. Visual effects remain excellent, even after 13 years. Yes, I saw it in theaters in 2013. Smith remains a great villain and Keanu as Neo remains iconic. The final battle in Zion and the final fight between Agent Smith and Neo goes down in history as two of the best demonstrations of visual effects that someone has created.\n",
            "\n",
            "The great sin of this film, that mystery and aura cease to exist, especially since the first Matrix. But it's still a great action movie and an astounding ending to the Neo saga. \n",
            "\n",
            "870 ) This movie feels like it was a chunk cut out of another film; barely anything happens- resolve the cliffhanger at the end of the previous film, main protagonists split up- some fight robots, others participate in the final fight, the end. This also seems to have a similar story pattern to Return of the Jedi. Some plot points in the movie seem useless like the bit at the start resolving the cliffhanger of Reloaded. It has no effect on the rest of the story and seems so slapped in and out of place. The new characters introduced in that part are never seen again afterwards and serve no purpose to the story. Also, many plot points seem rushed: Trinity dies (yes, I did say spoilers) and as she is a major character you would expect it to have more of an effect than what was given; after the scene it never appears to be brought up again. Some of the action seems off too- the first fight scene between Neo and Smith isn't good. There are loads of flashing lights so you can barely tell what is going on and the camera is really shaky too. Compare it to all of their other fight scenes in the trilogy and you just start to wonder what on earth went wrong there. At least their final fight was alright. Many people don't like the ending but I personally thought it was fine and probably the best way to end it; Neo's sacrifice seemed fitting and kind of gave him a new reason of being 'The One' for me which I liked. You can only really watch this movie if you've seen the other two as it is just a conclusion. There also isn't really much point of rewatching it as the point of watching it for me is to just find out the ending and not for the overall experience like the other two. Overall, this movie isn't that good. If you want to see the conclusion to the Matrix trilogy or that cliffhanger from Reloaded is really bugging you then I'd probably recommend this just to find out what happens and not for the overall experience. However, if you're just wanting to watch any movie at all then this one doesn't have the amount of fun the first two had and I'd probably give it a miss. 5.8/10 \n",

            "871 ) When the credits for the movie came up and yet another great song by Rage Against The Machine blaring in my ears, I just thought to myself, what a great piece of entertainment this movie was. I was a big fan of the first one (like other millions were) and was eagerly awaiting the sequel. Although it might not be as good as the first one in terms of it shocking us the way it did in 99 when it brought to us such a new flavour in cinema in terms of development in action, special effects and its terrific story. All and all it still held up very well considering the pressure this movie had on its shoulders to live up to the great expectation. I think that's why a lot of people weren't real keen on this one, because it had such huge pressure, and whatever the Wachowski's produced, it wasn't going to be good enough, or people would say it could or should of been better. I believe the Wachowski brothers made it more epic and like most sequels, you can tell that it had a s*** load more money to work with. Apart from the Zion scene and the Twins not getting enough screen time, this movie was right up there, and for a movie just to sit back in awe and watch all these fighting sequences, car chases and special effects in action, it's a special movie. \n",

            "873 ) The human city of Zion defends itself against the massive invasion of the machines as Neo fights to end the war at another front while also opposing the rogue Agent Smith. The Matrix Revolutions is by no means better than the first or second film i mean the first act is kinda slow but 2nd and especially the 3rd act are very good. The Mr. Smith vs Neo battle was very good sure it had some dumb cgi moments in it but overall a great enjoyable battle that pretty much is the highlight of the movie also the fact that Neo gets taken or probably he is dead nobody will ever know and Trinity died as well but the movie ends in a Happy way doesn't mean that it's a bad sequel i mean just look Terminator 2 for example Arnold dies and the world gets saved i don't compare a good sequel to one of the best movies ever made i'm just saying that every film sometimes deserves a good ending instead of a mass destruction one. Also don't try to compare this to Matrix or even Reloaded all this 3 movies are different on their own way and honestly i think this is the last good film the The Wachowski Brothers ever made but also if you play the game \"Path of Neo\" you will see that the ending is way different and longer than the one that the film has 8/10. \n",

            "874 ) The final film in the MATRIX trilogy and fans can breathe a sigh of release; (mostly) gone is the endless technobabble and philosophising of the middle film in the series, instead replaced by full scale action and resolution to the problems seen in the previous two films. This movie feels fresh and exciting because it offers us things previously unseen in the films. For the most part, this takes place in the \"real\" world, with only infrequent exertions into the computer-controlled fantasy world itself. It feels a lot stronger, gritter and harder than before because there is strong violence here, shocking bloodshed, and people really do die this time around. In many ways this makes it feel like more of an adult movie. Admittedly, things do start off a little strained. Although there is some good suspense and questioning in an isolated subway station, the action doesn't pick up until we get to a major gun battle in an S&M club.\n",
            "\n",
            "This battle is actually a little disappointing, although it is good to see the character Seraph return to the screen. Then we're re-introduced to the slimy French villain from THE MATRIX RELOADED, and his stunningly buxom wife played by Monica Bellucci (no complaints here). Yet the suspense fizzles instead of crackles, and the most entertainment here is to be had from the performance of the Train Man (played by Bruce Spence, the crazy chopper pilot from MAD MAX 2). It's certainly underwhelming, and lots more pointless inactivity doesn't bode well for the rest of the film. Then things suddenly start happening - it begins with the stabbing of a nurse and ends with Neo fulfilling his destiny. There are shocks, genuine surprises, and a fantastically-depicted war between humans and machines. It involves people walking around in ALIENS-style power robots and shooting machine guns at thousands of those pesky silver fish-like flying robots and it certainly does not disappoint in terms of ferocity, impact, and absolutely stunning special effects work.\n",
            "\n",
            "Things culminate in a scary, powerful finale involving Neo returning to the (now polluted) Matrix world to take on Agent Smith one last time. A fantastic and fitting conclusion to the lengthy battles in the earlier films, this strives to top them all. I loved the battle but bear in mind the kung fu is minimal compared to before. Performances are all assuredly good, with characters having by now settled into their parts, with top recommendations going to Hugo Weaving whose character of Agent Smith has major screen presence and makes for a threatening, frightening villain unlike last time. Basically I loved this movie and would be happy to re-watch it when the chance arrives. All three films are different, and very good indeed, so go check them out if you haven't done so already. \n",

I guess I agree that it's not good, but it's at least okay. Probably the best part is how it really does get better in the last two thirds. The first third of this movie is dreadfully boring and I just don't know why these actors aren't raising their voices. It makes everything rather bland. You can really notice the lack of emotion more in this, while it wasn't as apparent in the previous films. I think the main problem is how this film was paced.\n",

            "It shows twenty minutes of the humans in Zion fighting and then twenty minutes of Neo fighting. I would have enjoyed it more if it had combined the two. There was little variety that way. Nonetheless, there were definitely good things about the movie. The CGI is very good and it even seems to have improved from the last movie. Considering they were filmed right next to each other, that really is saying something. Hugo Weaving is just so entertaining as Smith. While it's difficult to take him seriously, it's still really hard to not be entertained on some level by this guy. I'm impressed by the sheer number of different roles he's had in popular franchises.\n",

            "The basic story is that the humans are fighting the machines while Smith has taken over the Matrix. Neo decides to go to the machine leader to stop fighting if he defeats Smith. I admit that this conclusion is really too convenient and seems like a cop out. It's still nice to see the conclusion of such a popular movie series. I bought \"The Matrix\" package films in one box set and I think it was money well spent. Even if the ending was mostly unsatisfactory, it's by no means awful. I guess I could recommend it if only because it's something that's really popular and does have some good variety. It even seems like they were trying to give all the characters some important role even though it didn't work out nearly as much as something like Return Of The King or Return Of The Jedi. I have a soft spot for third entries in a series...and also ones that have \"Return Of The\" in the title for some reason. **1/2 out of ****. \n",

            "877 ) The Matrix: Revolutions (2003): Dir: Andy Wachowski, Larry Wachowski / Cast: Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Laurence Fishburne, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett: Weakest of the Matrix trilogy about man's battle against machines. This was better established in The Terminator. Picking up where Reloaded left off, Neo awakens in a subway station where he is trapped outside the matrix and the train refuses his entry. Meanwhile Trinity, Morpheus and others set to rescue him while continuing the war against the machine army. Once Neo is rescued the screenplays descends into constant action, blazing violence and special effects that seem to go on and on. Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski who provide us with superb visual spectacle that is rushed to release too soon. Worse than the previous sequel with a disappointing ending just to add to insult. Keanu Reeves returns again as Neo with Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity. Their introduction is well established until it becomes constant bang bang and the low blow ending. Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus is reduced to a cardboard performance. Hugo Weaving as agent Smith throws out lines fit for a Saturday Night Live comedian. Jada Pinkett is also underused to the point of just showing up because she wasn't lucky enough to be in the original. Any spiritual parallels take a backseat to production values. Score: 3 / 10 \n",

The first time I watch it, I couldn't finish it because I did not understand it and I felt bored with the movie. The second time I kept watching I just enjoyed the movie and I wanted to know more, what will happen next. I think the movie end perfectly the trilogy, tough it did lack on a story and on the action, there very barely in it, that it was in the original and the second movie. The movie it self's focus more on the humans and the battles against the machines on the planet Zion, more than they are in the phone line of Matrix.

Revolutions was a mind-blowing layered ending that honored and respected the plot threads and themes introduced in the first two movies. The character arcs were satisfying and true to the characters introduced in The Matrix. The creators continued to challenge our understanding of the Matrix and its purpose, avoiding the temptation to serve us a bunch of \"their\" answers on a platter. That, to us, would have been a sellout of the vision they've been constructing, and wouldn't have been fair to us.

And, now as Neo learns more about his heroic powers--including the ability to see the codes of things and the people, he faces the consequences of the choice made in The Matrix Reloaded.

Just saying to all who think this movie (and/or the first two) sucked balls,- you are a minority. Movie is great, second one being the best in the trilogy. It is my second favorite film in the trilogy because it ends the story and answers what happened with Neo (Keanu Reeves), he saved Whole planet and defeat Smith (Hugo Weaving) on the end of the movie. This movie may not be the best in storyline, but hell it knows how to make action!

He is in fact trapped somewhere between the real world and the Matrix; in a location that looks like an underground station. If he is to get away he must confront 'The Train Man' and Morpheus and Trinity must re-enter the Matrix and visit The Merovingian once again. Once he is out there problems are far from over; Neo has a feeling that he must head to the City of the Machines, something nobody has successfully done before, and the others must head back to Zion with the last remaining pulse weapon.

At the end there is another Neo vs. Agent Smith fight but after the previous films this has a feeling of inevitability about it. The core cast do well enough although for much of the film they aren't really doing much as everything is focused on the battle for Zion. The military types are all gravel voiced and gung-ho in a way that is almost comical and you just know that the kid who has talked his way into the fight is going to play a key role in the end. It isn't a terrible film; it passes the time well enough and looks good; it is just a bit of a disappointment that the series had to end this way... to be honest I think it would have been better if 'The Matrix' didn't have any sequels as it didn't need them. \n",

It is not a bad movie and it can't be called a disaster, but I feel the original story presented in The Matrix was twisted too much and the whole trilogy now has a stigma of being very complicated and confusing (and after The Matrix that wasn't the case, it was very clean in terms of plot and characters, such movies should be very clear on the good guys/bad guys division). While The Matrix introduced a relatively believable plot and sci-fi concept, this third sequel spins out of control. That \"world between the two worlds\" makes no sense and also Smith being able to enter a human mind makes no sense. You could see machines reading peoples minds and creating dreams for them (which the matrix is, a delicately constructed dream for all humans), but not themselves becoming human minds. Also, too many characters, I don't see any added value in the Frenchman/Monica Bellucci subplot except for more fights and more loud music. While I can see that The Matrix \"asked\" for a sequel, I don't think it asked for a whole trilogy. The Matrix Reloaded was a nice one with some memorable scenes, but the third one is boring, dark, too slow and way to complicated for an action sci-fi flick. \n",

            "\n",
            "The first hour is slow and needless (for that matter, the entire second movie was unnecessary in the grand scheme of things). There's a scene at a fetish club that has no reason to be in there except to try to recreate the lobby scene from the original, only far less interestingly. The entire role of the Merovingian - that entire plot line - what was the point of that? It was completely superfluous and didn't play any real part in the end. But in the second hour, the redeems your ticket price.\n",
            "\n",
            "Some reviews complain that the leads all but disappear for a good half hour while we watch the supporting players defending the Zion invasion, trying to return to Zion, etc. The fact of the matter is, this was the best part of the film. I cared more about these people than the main characters. When we got back to Neo and Trinity, I was actually disappointed. Much of this movie felt like a video game: big action scenarios linked together with slow, questionably-acted cut scenes of dialogue. The final battle with Agent Smith and Neo? Cool enough - a true superhero slugfest, but dragged out and repetitive, much like Reloaded's \"burly brawl.\" And the end? well, I won't spoil that for anyone, except to say.... that's it? All this led up to THAT?!? \n",
            "\n",
            "892 ) Just like the second movie I found parts of this hard to fallow. But it was still a good movie, and I found it to be better then the second. However, the first one of course is the best for all three of them. But this one is great. I liked the war scenes. And I liked how it ended even though Neil dies. Neil makes a deal with the robot army that if he kills the due whom I forgot the name that they would end the war with the humans. Each action scene is good. The stunts and everything are as great as they where in the firs two movies. But I wasn't as blown away in this one as I was in the second one because I though the stunts and special effects would be better then the second since this was to be the end but they were the same. However it was a good movie just not what I had expected. \n",
            "\n",
            "893 ) I do find it odd the reaction these movies are getting. To be sure, the first Matrix movie was great and nothing like it had come before. It was a mix of martial arts, kung fu and 'super' tech. While nothing special with the dialog, the dialog was tight and crisp ... even in Keanu's monotone voice.\n",
            "\n",
            "Still, I was puzzled as to the reason for the human 'matrix' used by the machines and with that the whole story fell apart. It was still highly cool, but there was a big element missing in an otherwise excellent action/adventure story. There was no reason for humans in the 1st Matrix movie. It was explained that humans provided heat energy for the machines - however cows could have done just as well.. and even better taking much less in the way of resources.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which brings me to Reloaded and Revolutions - because you really can not compare one with out the others.\n",
            "\n",
            "Reloaded was definitely the weakest of the three, however it had some of the best scenes. Neo's fight with the Merovigian's henchmen was my fav and we learned there were predecessors to Neo's \"the one\". It also strongly hinted at a counter to \"the one\" .. in Agent Smith.\n",
            "\n",
            "Which finally brings me to Revolutions - aptly named as we now know its an on going process, but a process with a purpose. This movie is also much different than the first since its one part EPIC BATTLE for 'creation' (or mankind) and then some kung fu action guns scenes (though much less kung fu than the 1st). We know the 1st Matrix was perfect in every way - but it was also a disaster. We can speculate that after this disaster the Oracle was created, as the Architect clearly does not have the capacity to see beyond pure logic and his balanced equations.\n",
            "\n",
            "So why are humans needed? Humans are needed for the computers to evolve. Humans need choice - no matter how little - if they are to have a soul or free will. The architect did not understand this, but the Oracle does and so they play their game with the Ones - they human with free will (Neo) vs. the self aware program (Agent Smith), either can win, either can lose and as was shown Revoltions its possible they can all lose: ie Smith wins and destroys everything - even the machines - from the inside out.\n",
            "\n",
            "In my mind this was the best of the three - we have a conclusion that is not set in stone, but it resolves all the major issues. We know the Matrix has been saved (yet again) but its different this time -as Zion was spared because Neo was stronger than all previous 'the Ones'. It was not a perfect ending and that is perfect for me :) \n",
            "\n",
            "894 ) As usual, the original Matrix was the best. Reloaded was a solid follow up but didn't leave as much in question, or as much in replay value, as the original did. Revolutions however... I dunno. I got sick of the real world pretty fast in here, if you didn't like the real world in Reloaded prepare for some hell because about 75% of this movie takes place in the real world. Also, much like Reloaded, there isn't as much to learn about the Matrix as there was in the first one. It seems almost assumed that there is little left to learn about the Matrix which is more than just a little disappointing. Actors did just as good of jobs in this one as they did in the previous Matrixs. This one however I was most disappointed with. Mostly the ending is what made me frown but the final battle was another thing I yawned at. Sorry but leave a battle like this for the animes, it looks better. The Smith fight in Reloaded was 10 times better than this one. If you've seen the other two seeing this one probably won't do a whole lot for you. You'll probably end up frowning at the ending (much like I did). Movies with this much potential shouldn't feel so empty in the end. \n",
            "\n",
            "895 ) (I do not think what I write here can be counted as a spoiler, but I ticked the box just in case). The Matrix Revolutions is a brilliant conclusion to the trilogy, ending the perfect birth, life, death cycle that the whole story seems to explain. I found that this movie didn't grip me as much as the first two, the same as the second one didn't quite level up with the first. The thing is that not much happens in it, if you cut out the thousands of fight scenes then you'd be left with about half an hours worth of movie. I admit that I like battle scenes, I normally enjoy them a lot, but they were just too long and a little repetitive. The philosophical dialog in the first two movies has been replaced with guns and death, I was at least expecting Smith to do one of the usual 'psyche up fight talks' before the end, but not much was said, apart from 'I'm going to kill you' - something which is incredibly cliche in the good vs. evil world. I think that the main problem with The Matrix Revolutions is that the first too films asked questions that the final one couldn't answer. Simply because these questions are ones we have asked since the dawn of time and never been able to figure out. I like the idea that the point in life is death, it is interesting to look at, but apart from that there were no other deep points brought to light that had not already been thought of in the first two movies - and only one of them was actually mentioned. The final words were very apt for the movie, but I am still somewhat disappointed -- maybe that is just because I didn't want it to end. Part of me is still stuck in the fantasy world of the matrix, and I doubt I will ever escape it. \n",
            "\n",
            "896 ) This is better. Much better. Since the Matrix Reloaded never made any attempt at a conclusion (even a temporary conclusion such as those found in Kill Bill or Lord of the Rings), it ended in a slump. And that's exactly where this film starts off. In fact the first half hour is the weakest of the trilogy, as the Wachowski's try to work out what feels like a recycled part of the last film, the conclusion that never was. Here, we are forced to endure another horrific encounter with the Merovingian (though thankfully, not nearly as long), a lobby scene sequence that is pathetic after the action we have seen in the first two films, a useless subplot involving the Trainman, and Neo trapped in Mobil (Limbo) station. This is weak, very weak. But once the film gets past it, it takes on a new life. And the results are fantastic. The Wachowskis, having decided that more is better should be the motto of the second Matrix, take a daring, dangerous, and entirely original way with this one. After the first half hour, there is no Matrix scene until the conclusive battle between Neo and Smith. Thus there is none of the mind-bending, gravity-defying action, either. And none of the philosophic pontificating that marred the second film. This takes place almost entirely in the Real World, and, though a daring move, it is a successful one. The characters take on more life here. Indeed, one could even go so far as to say they do some acting. In this film, Neo and Trinity's relationship for the first time becomes something other than a plot gimmick, and there are actually moments of chemistry. Morpheus, though a side-seat driver for the entire film, gains much more humanity after his disillusionment (it also helps that there are not philosophy lectures for him to recite.) Many of the lesser characters are rendered in three-dimensions this time (the captain of the Hammer, Niobe, Link). As for the Oracle, the sudden cast change after the death of the first one for this film does not hurt it at all. In fact, this new Oracle is much more compelling than the original, and (partially because she has a much bigger role), is the one I now think of when I think of the Matrix. First prize still has to go to Hugo Weaving, who continues his transformation in the form of Smith to diabolical levels. He is exaggerated and overplayed, in a manner that is totally successful (one is reminded of Jack Nicholson). HIs twisted sense of humour is now in perfect balance with his cold, machine like evil. Also remarkable is the actor who portrays Bane, a human occupied by Smith. He renders Hugo Weaving's mannerisms so perfectly, one thinks it is Hugo Weaving in disguise (it might be, I haven't checked.) As for the action, it is amazing. The Battle for the Docks is something completely new, and absolutely terrifying. Indeed, (and as a huge Lord of the Rings fan, this is saying something), it is comparable in adrenaline-activity to the Battle of Pelennor Fields. 250,000 sentinels turn the battleground into a nightmare apocalyptic vision. As for Neo and Trinity, there quest to the Machine City is equally fascinating, showing the surface world we have only seen briefly as another nightmare. THere is even a moment of actual poetry in which, bursting above the clouds, Trinity becomes the first human in 100 years to see the sky. The Machine City itself is something like Dr. Seuss on acid, and the Deus Ex Machina is a rather scary version of the Head of Oz. As for the final apocalyptic fight between Neo and Smith, it is just that. The effects of the rain are magnificent as the two Titans clash far above the earth. And the actual conclusion to the story, something that I had no idea how the Wachowskis would bring about after the second one, is actually pretty surprising and rather clever. All this being said, there are still flaws. The battle between Smith and Neo is great until it crashes into the ground (literally), after which, the momentum is lost, and the final effect is rather awkward. There are still horrible lines, but thankfully, most of them are just one or two lines, instead of entire dialogues. The actual ending of the film leaves something to be desired, a sunset happy-go-lucky meeting that seems to come more from Harry Potter than the Matrix. But, flaws aside, this is a much better film than Reloaded, and though no where near the masterpiece of the original, is still a worthy successor. \n",
            "\n",
            "897 ) The Matrix Revolutions, the third part of Andy and Larry Wachowski's Matrix trilogy, fittingly ends what will be considered in the near future as one of cinema's classic trilogies. Though this third outing into the Matrix universe is the weakest of the three films, it's still an outstanding film with a great ending. Unlike part 2, this film has character development giving the main characters (Neo, Trinity, Morpheus, as well as new characters Link and Niobe) something to do with their characters. Although I am disappointed that most of the film doesn't take place in the Matrix itself, if you look at the structure of the trilogy, it does make sense and I respect the Wachowskis for sticking with their vision even if they did alienate some of their core audience. Again, Don Davis' score is superb (not as good as Reloaded's score but nearly up there and definitely better than his first Matrix score). This is a fitting 7 out of 10 and a must-see, if only to see how the Matrix trilogy ends. \n",
            "\n",
            "898 ) Picking up right we left in Reloaded, the machines are about to breach upon Zion, Neo is in a mysterious coma stuck between the matrix and the real world, Zion's defenses are being prepared, and finally Bane awakens; but in a very hostile manner. When Neo awakens too, he realises that he has to confront the source of the matrix and finally confront Agent Smith if Zion and all the people to survive. While he and Trinity both go to the Machine City, the others; Morpheus, Link, Niobi and the crew of the Hammer go back to Zion to help its defenses. Inside the dock of Zion, its an all out war. The machine diggers have breached the walls and thousands of sentinels are ready to kill all its inhabitants.\n",
            "\n",
            "The Matrix Revolutions is an all out action packed, visually amazing climatic conclusion to the matrix trilogy. The war of Zion is just amazing, the sentinels moving together as one being is just a sight to see. The action just keeps coming at a relentless pace. The chase of The Hammer ship being crawled over by hundreds of sentinels is also an amazing sequence. The Machine City is so detailed and has a real haunting presence with all the blue hues. The highlight of the film which everyone was waiting for is the final explosive showdown between Neo and Smith. While its a fight to remember, the only annoying part of the fight is when Neo and Smith start fighting in the sky and start flying around the place. It really took away from the intensity and over all impact of the fight.\n",
            "\n",
            "The visual effects are flawless, they are just so integrated that its hard to pick faults in them. Yet they do take away from the story. All the action and effects side step the narrative, making the plotting confusing at times. The fighting has also seem to lost that nobility from the first matrix, going for more style, losing that emotional core. The acting from everyone is very good, though abit over acted in places, but overall very good from all people. One part that didn't really need explaining though was the change in actor for The Oracle. Mary Alice who took over the role when Gloria Foster sadly died. It seemed pointless that they needed to explain why she looked different, adding confusion unless you've played the matrix game.\n",

            "\n",
            "This film, as well as Reloaded, has copped flak from many pop-culture soaked critics as well as the masses, due to their inability to see the genius and vision that is interwoven into this trilogy. The action is in-your-face, the symbolism is deep and enchanting - if you get it, which the majority of movie-goers do not, and that's the problem. One critic for Reloaded actually said, \"I want my action films dumb and stupid\" - which speaks for most of this film's Western audience. I recommend observing the Philosopher Commentaries of the 10-disc set DVD's mostly because they open up much of the hidden meanings of these films, and they show how 90% of the negative critics simply had no right to pass any kind of judgment.\n",
            "\n",
            "See this trilogy. I can safely say that if you didn't like it, then it wasn't that the films were uninspired - it was just you, who wanted a spoon-feeding. \n",

            "\n",
            "I believe for the final installment in one of the biggest movie trilogies, Revolutions was above exceptional. The ambiance and dramatic mood throughout the movie was a wise choice by the Wachowski brothers. Many of the un-answered questions that left you cliffhanging in the second are answered. And I understand that some questions weren't answered, and for those I ask you to refer to perhaps The Aniematrix or some of the movies special features.\n",
            "\n",
            "The acting is good, especially Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Morpheus (Luarence Fishburne). Other characters include Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). The action is incredible. A 20 minute war scene between the robots and the humans might possibly be the most amazing thing you'll ever see sitting in a movie theater too.\n",
            "\n",
            "But seriously, this movie was over-looked and didn't deserve enough respect that it should have. The conclusion to the most famous trilogy of all time, beside LOTR, was not a let down at all. See it, it will blow you away. \n",
            "\n",
            "901 ) As the trilogy came to an close, the viewers were looking for the supreme ending. An edge-breaker. A new dimension to film making so to speak. One film to rule them all, well, rule LOTR's anyway! And, as a matter of fact, they got it. But did anyone take notice of it? No! Why? Simple. Because there wasn't enough \"action\". Am I missing something? Fair enough, the ending has all the passion and finesse of a one legged duck holding a toilet brush. But aside from that; what was the big problem? People mostly complain about the film being rushed, and fair play to them it was. But does that mean that the storyline has suffered dramatically? The only major reason that I can think of to explain people's distaste to this film is the simple fact that they do not understand it. Now, with all honesty, I too believe that the plot and tone of this film would feel more at home in an episode of a gardening show hosted by some washed up 80's actor who hasn't worked for years and mostly lives on a healthy diet of Big Macs and toe nail clippings. But nevertheless the story is compelling and near impossible to turn away from until you can just catch a grasp of the meaning before it is ultimately pulled away from your clutches. This is the reason why many people turn back to this film with enjoyment and love for the work put into it. It might look like The Wachowski Brothers ran through this film faster than curry and lager run through you on a Sunday morning, giving us the main reason as to why the story makes almost no sense whatsoever! But no, the reason why it is so complicated is why it is so beautiful... The reason for the bad ending is to divert us from the real questions: What really is The Matrix? Is Neo only one of a kind? Did the creator of the Matrix merely lie to Neo to catch him off guard? Do the machines really know what is going on? When a Sentinel appears on screen, why do I always have the urge to go buy some Calamari? All in all, the movie isn't rushed, in fact it is cleverly designed to make us believe the uncertainties. Well, that must've made more sense than why the Oracle changes into a different person......hmm.... \n",
            "\n",
            "902 ) what did you expect? too much, I suspect. considering the can of worms it opened itself in the first movie, I'd say the loose ends were gathered together quite well by revolutions. let's see all you people try to come up with a good, satisfying conclusion! there is still a lot of interesting stuff to read into in revolutions, and you don't even need to read too deeply to find a satisfactory solution to the trilogy. okay, so it wasn't the greatest...but it wasn't that bad, either. despite the decline as it went on, the series as a whole is still 9/10 in my eyes, for all the neat ideas it brought up and explored. \n",

            "1 )  I like John Cusack. He usually makes some pretty good movies. This movie is a dog. I know movies stretch the imagination, but this one wants you to remove you head and not even think. The physics are just WAAAAAAY to hard to believe. Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are nowhere near as big as they are in this movie. And its just a stupid plot all together. \n",
            "\n",
            "2 ) 2012 starts off with a bang with strange re-occurring events all over the world. The movie focuses on failed writer Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) trying to lead his family to nirvana in a world of disaster. When the global chaos finally arrives, a plethora of cheesy acting and deliberate stunts, failure hits this movie like puberty.\n",
            "\n",
            "Chiwetel Ejiofor is the only reason you could consider giving this movie any sort of recognition. He portrays an average scientist who partially uncovers the expiration date for humanity. There is plenty of emotion that comes from the actors, but at some points in the film you are LAUGHING at how poor the scene is setup.\n",
            "\n",
            "Johann Urb and Zlatko Buric are disgusting. It really makes you wonder how hard it would be to catch a role in a big picture. John Cusack loves to yell and curse but otherwise provides nothing to the film. The children are annoyances to what could've been some cool 'survival' esque parts of the film.\n",
            "\n",
            "While plenty of money was spent for CGI, editing, and props, the film does not deliver in these categories. Some of the CGI is impressive but at certain times the green-screen backdrops are uncanny and appear unrealistic. Speaking of unrealism- they drive a car out of a plane's hangar!\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, 2012 was a failed conception of an apocalypse. You can see how bad it even was- it lost money in the initial box office as compared to budget. At some times you are bored, and other times you are laughing at how poorly scripted, acted, and edited this film is. The one thing that works okay is Chiwetel Ejiofor's actions of justice and some of the scenery.\n",
            "\n",
            "4/10 \n",
            "\n",
            "3 ) Shame on John Cusack for taking on the main role in this movie - must have needed for money!!! The storyline is ridiculous enough, but the CGI is really just laughable.\n",
            "\n",
            "I would like to think this movie was made as a spoof of this genre, but horrifyingly it wasn't!!! Every cliche in the book was featured in this movie - including risking personal life for the sake of a beloved dog!!!\n",
            "\n",
            "The acting is pretty dire from everyone! The movie really is an insult to most people's intelligence and should be avoided at all costs. I thought Jupiter Ascending was bad, but I'm not sure whether this one outdoes that!!!!! Personally I'm not going to waste my time pondering that thought! \n",
            "\n",
            "4 ) Please excuse me for delving into our political and cultural conditions to review this film. I know my hands are sort of tied that way as Hollywood can't help itself in using their neo-blockbuster movies to beat the rest of us over the head with their misapplied feng shui idealism.\n",
            "\n",
            "You know how they go - fractured family realizes they belong together thanks to some unlikely disaster to befall humankind, the President waxing philosophical of their predicament as it relates to the issues of our day, humans are bad and need to die so that the rest of the bad humans who lived can move on while forgetting the lessons of the film, visual metaphors to underscore the moral of the story and lastly, not one iota of common sense throughout the movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "What makes this one especially bad is that it catered to children. Not that child entertainment is a bad thing, but imprinting the fertile minds of young movie-goers with the supposed 2012 end of days tripe. They (who come up with such ideas for films) think they're smart enough to tell everyone else how to live while ignoring what they already should have learned.\n",
            "\n",
            "The scientist in me would love to know how planes can take off of ground surfaces which are falling into the sea, then be seen trying to navigate newly-formed canyons in a state of flux themselves. And what is wrong with trying to fly OVER falling buildings? Another thing, why does everybody have to wait until the last minute (much less stand and stare at an erupting volcano) to evacuate? I never understood that.\n",
            "\n",
            "Finally, the thing I most disliked about this movie is how it suggests that the United States has the market cornered on being bad even if the general theme was that all of humanity needed a reboot. Every country has a dark underbelly (its the cost of dealing with other countries which have the darkest of underbellies) and ours is no worse than any before it. I didn't appreciate the scene of an aircraft carrier taking out the President and the White House. I'll never understand how people can take such shots at a country they make a good chunk of change in. I think they should be banned from ever entering the borders, but that's just me.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'm not religious, but the symbolic imagery of the crack forming between God and man on the Vatican ceiling didn't get by me. I get it Hollywood, the Catholic God is the only bad one. When you go after other religions I won't think of you as soft opportunistic bullies who've hijacked the freedom of expression to advance your political agenda against the nation which makes it possible.\n",
            "\n",
            "Movies like this make me sick - even when I view them for free. \n",
            "\n",
            "5 ) First off, I found that the attempt at humor at this time of destruction was unnecessary and weak. Mr Roland does this quite a bit in his movies when there is total havoc occurring and then 'tries' to break the tension with an attempt at humor. I honestly think this approach has made some of his movies seem silly. I mean, isn't that what we see these movies for? The tension? (Case in point also \"Godzilla\" and \"ID4\"). All these movies had great potential for the human element but instead focused on effects rather than the human scale of tragedy. These were not funny situations so why try to be funny? It fails in my opinion. Don't make a serious situation then lace it with laughs. Now if your are like a lot of viewers today and could care less about any believability, then this is the movie for you! If all you crave is explosions, earthquakes, tidal waves and the like then you wont care if the characters are/act stupid. But there are some of us out there who like the action but ALSO like some realistic approaches when it comes to people, not stereotypes & silly accents. Yes, this movie is about the end of the world, billions upon billions of deaths, disaster all around and it should be treated in a darker manner instead of like watching an afternoon matinee of Dagwood Bumstead. Its very hard to sympathize with any character since the script seemed to fail in every direction. I mean, why spend 200 million just to have people laugh and be uncaring? Effects, effects, effects is the answer. It seems all people want anymore is just a bunch of explosions on the silver screen. Some of us crave a bit more than visual stimulation. Now, like I stated that if its just \"Bing Bam Boom\" is all you want, then this is the flick but if you want a bit more of a human story then I would steer clear. I honestly believe giving this a 5 star rating is being overly generous. I leave it up to the viewer to decide. \n",

The parts between all the action are mostly tedious and dull, with its half- hearted account of typical American life offering nothing that hasn't been done a thousand times before. The the world then goes to cock leading to some amusement park style effects ride as the family drive/fly through entire cities falling down around them in a manner that wouldn't convince a 5 year old. Then the focus is on giant arks created for the wealthy classes of the world to some how live on after these terrible events, but in reality no wealthy person will hand over any money for these super arks to be built because it's such a stupid , overly elaborate idea in the first place.

Usually a series of bad ideas ends in nullification or death, but not 2012, somehow it goes on. That is impressive. Zero plot multiplied by zero dialog divided by zero acting equals what?

When Roland Emmerich did The Patriot in 2000 I completely enjoyed it and hailed it as the best colonial movie ever made and this just leaves me with one question what was he thinking while making this true piece of crap.

In a real-life global disaster of this magnitude, we all know the odds of a family all surviving together, finding a plane, finding ANOTHER plane and flying halfway across the world to crash-land in the mountains and then be driven to salvation in the form of modern-day arks, is ridiculous.

Between the compassionate idealist 'Adrian Helmsley' (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and the practical, very unfair 'Carl Anheuser' (Oliver Platt). There are many scenes that depict one too many narrow escapes. You need to overlook the drive through the building. Focus on the concept, and battle of wills. In the story, Anheuser has taken charge, and it is set up in such a way that we are to not like him. When you began to know that the life as we know it was going to cease to exist. Helmsley asks Anheuser what he is going to do with his other ticket, that is, his ticket to survive. He replies 'Nothing', that it was not practical for his mother to get on board, and that his relationship with his girlfriend was strained, so too bad for her! Later you find out that he is involved in some sinister plots to get art work into areas that will be saved. How did they finance the building of the saving devices? Anheuser again. \"Sir I have a large family, 1bill dollars is a lot of money?\". \"I'm sorry, it's 1bill euros\". Anheuser orchestrated the sale of tickets! Of course all completely unfair way to make sure people survived, and the program was funded. But if you pay attention to the movie, without Anheuser, there would be no way the whole thing would work. Anheuser says \"What life isn't fair? You can go give your tickets to some of the workers, if you want!\" Of course the thought at that moment was ridiculous. In the end he makes sense. The guy is so wrong, unfair, but at the same time, one of the only ways the whole thing might actually work within the bounds of the 'suspension of disbelief'. Meanwhile Helmsley throughout the movie is trying to save as many as he can. He complains at the size of his cabin, yet it only appears to be about 12x10. Saying: \"You can fit 10 people in here?\" Helmsley has read and aspires to the novel written by the main character 'Jackson Curtis' (John Cusack) which is supposedly overly idealistic novel. At the same time in our real world, it is unfortunately the mean guys like Anheuser who get things done, and get ahead, and become heads of large corporations and/or countries, not the good people like Helmsley. \n",

The CGI here is OK, direction is marginal, music is weak. Be sure to avoid the music at the end, it is just trash. How they ever decided to include that song is way beyond me. The movie's dramatic moments are predictable and weak. Some actions by characters are just stupid. There are massive plot holes; why, for instance, would rich people be able to buy a seat in the ark when money will be useless? Why did people stay behind for no apparent reason?

I know that the CGI and Pandora are supposed to be so amazing that you fail to recognize that during any emotional scene, they increase the sound of the music so you don't recognize the awful acting. Part of that terrible acting is the script. It's so stupid that one would have to be mesmerized by the special effects to not notice it. Let's look at it this way. You have the Ore that floats in the D-bag's office. If the ore floats on it's own, why would the company waste its time drilling when it could just take a floating mountain away? If it wasn't floating because it has no floating properties, why would you not just start with the floating mountains. Seriously, if these masses of rock are just floating in the sky, that would be extremely beneficial for things like flying or movie heavy objects with less friction.

            "I tell you all of this because I just believe Les Miserables is just directed in a way where it ether just doesn't look good, confusing, or just boring. However, my complaints aren't connected to the acting in the film. For as much as Russell Crow has been criticized by critics for his horrific singing, he's still Russell Crow. He brings a solid performance of honor, determination, and authority. Hugh still gives his best singing and acting wise. And Ann Hathaway gave her role as Fantine her best. If this was shot in a way that was slow or tense or at the very least normal, this could've worked. Sort of what Joe Wright did for Pride and Prejudice , just a solid adaptation of classic with enough standout performances to make it an independent piece art but still keeping it to the source material so that you can say \"they made that\". But that's not what they wanted. They wanted an action adventure with dark deaths, harsh outcomes, and ambiguity... with singing! That's the biggest problem with the movie. It's not sure if it wants to be an independent piece of art or faithful to the original musical. So, after a dramatic sequence where someone important dies, you might get some random slapstick that isn't even funny. It also wants to be a dark comedy along with being a dramatic piece of art. This works, if you're given a world you can fully embarrass. In Pulp Fiction, you laugh at horrific scenes because the protagonists didn't know what was truly going to happen. So it felt like you, a person with morals, could understand how insane these people really are. But in Les Miserables, there is no consistency with the kind of world they're living. It just says, \"There needs to be humor now\" or \"there needs to be drama now\". There is no over arcing tone to it all.\n",
            "\n",
            "But, I'll say it again; the actors really buy into what is going on. They fully devote themselves to these roles. So, is it good? Well, in my opinion, I believe it's weak. I personally hate weak films because I can't particularly hate them nor can I like them. But it's worth a watch just for the actors or cultural value. But, if you had the choice between this film and Silence of the Lambs, I'd choose Silence of the Lambs. \n",

            "46 )  For fans of the musical, it is spellbinding to watch Les Miserables finally come to life on the big screen. However, for the typical movie goer or even a fan in retrospect, it's clear that the movie doesn't know quite what it wants to be. It's a mess of gloomy, gritty sequences mixed with animated, silly, or downright ridiculous imagery. Although there are some great voices, the majority of the film consists of terrible singers, which feels so out of place with all of the great instrumental. Mix in some awkward, unbelievable CGI long shots and strange, uncomfortable camera angles, and now we have the Les Mis movie, and we aren't going to get a new one any time soon. However, the film is better than most of the movie musicals that we get. And, at the end of the day, Les Mis is like pizza. Even when it's done poorly, it's still pretty good. \n",

Director Tom Hooper should have told young Daniel Huttlestone ( Gavroche ) that he was no longer playing a part in \"Oliver.\" His cockney accent in the middle of Paris was ridiculous. \" Stone the Russell Crowes guv.

It is so out of line with the original trilogy from the beginning the opening scene like 75% is really boring and the title crawl should make fascinated to see what happens but in this movie it leaves you confused. Some of the CG worlds are cool but you can't develop characters from 12 different worlds. Jar Jar Binks drives me round the bend and it is quiet long. Padme is so plain and boring and you really couldn't care less if she died or not Obi Wan and Qui gon have good chemistry it is a shame that Qui GOn dies. Darth Maul has potential to bve a massively cool villain but they give him no character time and I think he is just there for the awesome duel at the end. Jake Lloyd is very annoying and the pod racing isn't exciting because you don't care about any of the characters. Overall boring with 1 cool scene. \n",

An alleged experienced pilot like Anakin pressed two buttons (starting his spaceship and activating auto pilot) looking for the trigger to the gun, before he actually grabs the obvious control!! Most of the movie is about federation tax (Yawn) there are some serious plot holes (why is technology more advanced than in the previous three movies, which are set in the future?? What happened to the blockade of the planet?? Why were Qui Gon and Padme still with Anakin when they hear about the sand storm) we don't see the Jedi do anything except destroy droids till the end. Terrance Stamp is woefully underused, and it definitely needs some trimming here and there, do we really need all the repeated reaction shots (like when Padme reveals she is the Queen) and one of the biggest sins for me is, Darth Maul is a real bad ass, and they kill him off in the the first movie (and would he really just stand there and let Obi Wan flip over him, instead of slicing him in half??)

What I need to tell you won't take very long at all; I don't like \"Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.\" I don't expect you to like it. It has oodles of horrendous dialogue even by the low standards of the Saga, it's been a destructive force in the reputation of the otherwise underrated and masterful \"Star Wars\" prequels, it joins \"The Force Awakens\" as one of only two \"Star Wars\" movies I refuse to watch when marathoning the Saga. I don't like it. But this isn't a popularity contest. It's a movie review. And subjective opinions aside...\"The Phantom Menace\" IS a good movie.\n",
            "\n",
            "I'll start out with the cons, as there are some EXTREMELY big ones. First of, Jar Jar Binks. While some people take the hatred of the character too far (Calling him a racist stereotype? SERIOUSLY?), he's still pretty unfunny and just downright detestable. I am a fervent believer in the \"Darth Jar Jar\" theory which insists that Jar Jar was ORIGINALLY intended to be a dark mirror to Yoda (The seemingly insignificant, annoying comic relief-esque character who turns out to possess great wisdom, power and knowledge), but because the idea was abandoned after Jar Jar's awful fan reception, he just ends up as a wholly distracting and painfully irritating failed \"comedic\" character. A shame, as if previously mentioned fan theory were correct and followed through, we could have had a villain as epic and sinister in scale as the Emperor himself.\n",
            "\n",
            "The child actors are absolutely abysmal. Jake Lloyd as little Anakin Skywalker is JUST as bad as everyone says he is. Every time he opens his mouth to speak, I get a little tingle in my fingers to press the mute button to silence his wooden, obnoxious delivery. True, he's not helped by the fact the film features some of the worst dialogue in the Saga (\"Are you an angel?\"), but I can easily imagine a child actor like Daeg Faerch or Brady Allen running circles around Lloyd's \"acting.\"\n",

            "Natalie Portman is similarly awful as Padme Amidala. While I greatly enjoyed her performances in \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\", she is totally out of her element here.

            "\n",
            "Ewan McGregor is simply boring as Obi Wan Kenobi in \"The Phantom Menace\" with next to NO personality or even desire. As Robert McKee from Adaptation says, \"You cannot have a protagonist without desire, it doesn't make any SENSE!\" Granted, like Portman he would vastly improve in \"Attack of the Clones\", but in \"The Phantom Menace\" he's merely a blank slate.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you thought the tonal shifts in \"Return of the Jedi\" were jarring and awful, \"The Phantom Menace\" will all but drive you insane. One minute you'll have very serious, intellectual discussion of the Republic debating how to deal with an ominous trade blockade or Darth Maul brooding alongside his evil master Darth Sidious, and the next minute you'll have Jar Jar stepping in crap and smelling Eopie farts. It makes immersion into the film almost impossible.\n",

            "Liam Neeson is outstanding as Qui Gonn Jinn, a character so fascinating and with so much depth that it makes me even more frustrated with how poorly his original trilogy equivalent Ben Kenobi was written in \"A New Hope.\" He has the wisdom and stoicism you'd expect, but his rebellious, chaotic \"ends justify the means\" approach to solving problems is surprising and makes for a more interesting mentor figure. At the same time, he is incredibly empathetic and loyal to those close to him, seeing the value in those who may not even see it in themselves. Neeson does an excellent job balancing Qui Gonn's warmth, wisdom, passion and intensity in a very nuanced performance that is easily the best in the movie. Not often do we have anti-establishment mentors in science fantasy, and when we do it's rarely as subtle as with Qui Gonn in \"Episode I.\" Thus when he loses his life at the hands of the demonic Darth Maul in the film's climactic lightsaber duel, it truly stung me emotionally. It's a vast improvement over Ben Kenobi's emotionally barren death in \"A New Hope.\"\n",

            "While the jarring shifts in tone may be distracting, the film does at least touch on some clever themes. The idea and message of symbiosis (Multiple organisms working together for mutual benefit) is consistent throughout the movie through its characters and relationships as well as the concept of the symbiotic midichlorians; microscopic organisms that represent Jedi's connection to the Force. Many critics have pointed out that midichlorians remove the mysticism behind the Force, but perhaps we're looking at it from the wrong view. Perhaps midichlorians are created through force of will and faith, rather merely existing immediately upon birth regardless of will. It's at the very least a thought provoking concept.\n",

Also, Obi Wan is supposed to grow because of the death of his master. He cannot relies on master, ant the time comes when he has to becomes independent.By the way, this movie (Star Wars series) always brings unique villains. Their appearances, the ways of fighting, and characters are differ from each one. I think this is because not only attract audience, but also make the hardships for Jedies.

I believed the haters went in expecting to be blown away and because they didn't leave the theater with that euphoric feeling they had after episodes 4,5 and 6 a void was created and then was filled with anger.

Then they saw the flick and the backlash was an epic one and rightfully so. In case and point, the cgi are ugly to put it polite, the majority of the characters are either racist stereotypes like Jar Jar Bing (curse to be!) ,boring like Padme Amidala or both and for the case of the Jedi council ,which is useless, I mean a PLANET is under foreign occupation by one of senate members and they just do nothing. Why? You are consider to be the protector of the Galaxit Rebuplic and you have the Force. Understood if you can not sent the whole Jedi membership ,but sent at least more than two people when the situation goes to hell. To add to that the battle of Naboo is a CGI mess,they tried to do again the battle of Endor, and we get a CGI mess and a boring (if that is possible) Space Battle, in Star Wars!! The only good things are Liam Neeson performance, the pod racing and Darth Maul, this three small bits proved the Menance to become unwatchable.

            "65 ) Star Wars, the Phantom Menace had to be THE biggest let-down of the 1990's, if not the whole decade. For years, many Star Wars fans, like myself, awaited with baited breath for the return of the Force so we could learn what led to the demise of Anakin Skywalker and how he became Darth Vader. It starts with the Trade Federation placing an embargo on the planet, Naboo. Sent to negotiate are two Jedi Knights, Qui Gon Jin (Liam Neeson), and and young Obi Wan Kenobi (Ewan MacGregor). The Trade Federation tries to kill them and they flee to the planet Naboo. There, they meet Jar Jar Binks who leads them to Princess Amidalla (Natalie Portman). They flee in her spaceship which is damaged and forced to land on a desert world, Tatooine. There, they meet a young Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) who is a slave and a great pod racer. After making a few bets, Qui Gon Jinn befriends the would- be Sith Lord and gets back to the capital world, Coruscant. He takes the boy because he has strong proclivities to the Force. There, the boys meets a CGI Yoda along with Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson), and a rising political figure, Senator Palpatine (Ian McDiarmind). He convinces Amidalla to propose a vote of no-confidence in the Chancellor so he can use political clout to help them. Once that is done, Amidalla, Qui Gon, Obi Wan, Anakin and an annoying Jar-Jar return to Naboo for a full conflict. This movie goes from bad to worse, to more worse, to even more worse, and even more worse. The movie suffers from poor characters, weak story, poor conflict, and uneven direction. First are the characters. There is no-one for movie audiences to identify with. The Jedi are larger than life and epic, having little to no faults. There is no doubt, no longing for adventure, no fear, and no personality. Jar Jar Binks is the only one with personality, but it is annoying, ripping off all the cheesy lines from Full House while sounding like Roger Rabbit. Jake Lloyd as a young Anakin has no doubt, no fear, and actually flies a fighter in a battle. The poor dialog adds to this malaise. The story, too, is weak. At age 10, I found it easy to track the story of A New Hope, but will kids track this one? I doubt it. A bigger drawback is that special effects take precedence over the story. Lucas, now with the help of computers, places so much into the scene it takes the focus off the characters and what they are doing (or talking). And within this story there is no conflict because not only can you not identify with any of the characters, but also you don't find any hatred for the bad guys. In fact, the Battle Droids are just as cheesy and comical as Jar Jar. Finally, there is uneven direction. Lucas is not a master director. As a story board artists, and as executive producer, he shines through. This is prevalent at the climatic battle when three stories are going on and it is hard to follow. The only thing I liked was the Jedi battle with the Sith, Darth Maul, who wields a double-edged light saber. That was cool, and fun to watch. The only problems, it last about five minutes in a movie that is 130 minutes. I made a point to see the movie again, thinking I had become too cynical. No. After that, I was convinced this was the misfire of a man who used to be able to tell a simple story. \n",

            "66 ) Episode 1 is a bad movie and I can understand why people must have been so disappointed with the outcome one of the most hyped movies of all time and it sucks. In my opinion episode 2 is the worst but episode 1 is still a bad movie.

The script now am not gonna say its awful because its not but I wouldn't have Anakin be a 10 year old kid I would have him be roughly 17 years old and is Obi Wans Pad wan because the prequel trilogy is suppose to show Anakin fall from being a Jedi not him becoming a Jedi then becoming a Sith. Now the villain of the movie Darth Maul one of the best and underused Star wars characters. Darth Maul should have been the villain though the whole trilogy right until the end. Now on to Jar Jar Binks I hate that piece of crap he was there to have the comedy aspect in the movie but couldn't do that Jar Jar is awful at everything he does and if he is a secret Sith lord I would be fine with that probably. \n",

My wife actually had not seen the other films before this and could have watched them all in episode order. Too bad the movie was too painfully slow and boring to allow that. It's obvious that this film rides the coattails of the others too much. Providing back-story doesn't have to be boring. I haven't even bought the DVD version because I know I'll probably never watch it. Indeed, this film foreshadowed problems with the whole prequel trilogy. Lucas could have improved on the originals with better writing, story and character development. Other reviewers are right in saying that the effects have taken center stage.

A team of tough mercenaries is hired by CIA in a half clandestine way to go to a Latin American Island ruled by a dictator with the complicity of a CIA deserter who also lead a huge drug trafficking business. Their mission is to kill the dictator The gang men are very muscular as usual with Sylvester Stallone which is very helpful in physical struggles they have to get involved in. A sentimental detail is introduced in this violent climate when the Stallone's character takes a liking to the dictator's daughter who is betraying her father and acts also to save her from the grab of the CIA deserter.

He even gets helped in both films by a girl related to the dictator. *Spoilers end here* But while in the first move there is at least a tiny grain of realism, here there is nothing but exaggeration. The mercs are superhuman who cannot be harmed and 5 of them defeats a whole army (btw don't get fooled by the cover: there won't be that many people in any mission only like 5), they are so pure hearted they don't care about the money, the main antagonist is as evil as Dr. Evil etc. And what really blew my mind was that utterly stupid plot device that - as I mentioned earlier - the mercs didn't care about the money, and wrecked the whole nation FOR ONE GIRL!!! Those damn white knights! Thet's the stupidest idea I've ever heard! As others have mentioned even the action scenes are so overly exaggerated they lack even the tiniest grain of realism thus challenging seriously your suspension of disbelief.

The Expendables is as loud, dumb and flashy as you'd expect, but it's just no fun. Surprisingly, there's not much action in it neither, well, not nearly as much as I expected. The fight scenes were pretty lousy too; you couldn't see what anybody was doing and when you could see they were pretty unspectacular and uninspired. I was really looking forward to seeing one of my favourite Mixed-Martial Artists - Randy Couture - in hand-to-hand combat, but he hardly fought, in fact he was hardly in the movie. For a movie that boasts all the action stars ever, shouldn't we be going from set-piece to set- piece that showcases the things that we made us love these action stars in the first place? All in all, I never expected Oscar-worthy material, but for an action movie and given the action talent on hand it was really unoriginal, uninspired and just plain boring.

Dolt Lundgren!! - only missing Jean Claude Van Dumb; Chuck Nowits and of course Steven Seagull for the full line-up of talentless; monosyllabic dim wits. Thinks it's witty but absolutely nowhere near Die Hard or Terminator - not as funny as Predator even. As for plot and dialogue - knocked out by a three year old in five minutes. I know the film is a joke riffing on past glories (!) but it is just lame.

You gotta have some humor to get along with, otherwise this movie would be boring. Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are the powerhouses of the team. Elite mercenaries who do dangerous missions and get paid for it. However, there was a member of the team who gets careless and ends up messing up. Whoever it was, I'm not saying. The action is nonstop, and there are some scenes that closely like some of Sly's earlier movies. The street scene resembles the 1986 movie \"Cobra\". He has another souped up classic Ford truck. Lundgren and Stallone starred in \"Rocky IV\". I guess you can call it a small reunion together. Well, it's true! This movie also stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Bruce Willis in small, minute roles.

The questions are about how people who regard themselves as \"good\" can do terrible things and justify it to themselves. \"The Godfather\" posits one of the universal problems in life - what is the nature of evil, and how can we recognize it in all its forms?

The Godfather movie is quite boring for me. The actions and everything are quite slow and in monotone. The shooting scene in the movie was radiculous and not realistic. The shooting is quite bad as it is an old movie which I understand. The story line is quite simple and quite straight. As I watched this movie, I forced myself to not fall asleep.

Most of this boils down to that I don't believe the Matrix was intended to be anything more than a single movie. The first movie was a trend setter, it inspired an entire new filming technique as is a classic in it's genre. I actually thought Reloaded was clever, at least it provoked thought and discussion.

(Jar-jar and the little girl who is the last exile. What a coincidence) Then the warriors go to fight evil. (Qui-gon & Obi-wan and Neo & Trinity) After a lot of mixed other stuff, we arrive at two final battles, one with armies and one with main characters. (Q-g & O-w meet Darth Maul and Neo & Tri. meet Smith.) Both movies have good fights, but then everyone dies. (Obi-wan dies just a little later than the others do) After all that, we are told that we should look to the future for hope. (Let us not forget the idea that we have to make a choice to do so.) The only thing that is different is that Star Wars jumps from battle to battle every few minutes and Matrix waits until one is done and then switches.\n",
            "\n",
            "Overall, I do think that the movie is okay. The effects do out-weigh the plot in this one, just because the other two Matrix movies back it up. I would give it a 7.5 out of ten if I could, but they do not allow half points. \n",
            "\n",
            "93 ) The matrix and its concepts are actually based on the Concepts in Bhagvad Gita. Its a religious concept of the Hindus( in India).\n",
            "\n",
            "Bhagvad gita is a book containing principles of life.If you can read the English translation of the book.......you will find the similarities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Even the diologue's has been directly taken from the book. Wachowski brothers have tried hard to make it look real.They tried hard to adapt it into the world of super computers and robots. Even though the movie is well made. Its not right for the Directors to Take the credit. The movie is inspired by the Hindu book. \n",
            "\n",
            "94 ) I have seen this Movie today, Revolutions has a overdose of CGI, boring fights,cool sun glasses, and Shirow's Mechas, but where are the ideas? The Matrix pretentious franchise ends worse than any other planned trilogy, an ambiguous finish preparing for Matrix 4 that not fill my curiosity. Keanu Reeve`s face look as Rushmore`s one. Why are all the character so retarded? I want Agent Smith Kick Neo's ass, In fact, with Reloaded, the two worst movies ever seen.\n",
            "\n",
            "95 ) \"The Matrix Revolutions\" suffers from the same problems that plague \"Reloaded\", although this time there's an unshakably depressing tone. The movie has a sort-of hopeful ending, but it's still a major downer, and the core three characters deserved better. And a sizable chunk of the movie's running time is spent on the garish Zion scenes (sure, that's where the film's humanity is, but I kept wanting to return to the admittedly more striking world of the Matrix).\n",
            "\n",
            "But the movie's preoccupied with the idea of Neo and Smith as two variables in a larger equation. And the weird thing is that, for that larger theme and for all of the fight moves and bullets fired, everything comes down to an underwhelming Superman fistfight.\n",
            "\n",
            "It shouldn't be this boring. That's the most disappointing thing about all of this.\n",
            "\n",
            "3/10 \n",
            "\n",
            "96 ) The Wachowski Brothers returned to direct this conclusion to the trilogy as Neo(played by Keanu Reeves) finds himself trapped on a train station, which is the mid-point between the real world and the Matrix. Still reeling from the revelations told him by the Architect, Neo must fulfill his destiny to end the war with their machine masters, who are mercilessly attacking Zion, creating destruction and death. Rogue agent Smith(played by Hugo Weaving) is determined to kill Neo, after gaining the powers of the Oracle, and Neo must take Trinity(played by Carrie Ann-Moss) with him to barter peace with the machines, kill Smith, and fulfill his destiny as \"The One\" for his mentor Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) Disappointing conclusion to the trilogy is overly reliant on bloated F/X, mind-numbing battle scenes, and a general sense of disbelief that this is how it ends? Some good ideas are lost in this hopeless mess. \n",
            "\n",
            "97 ) You've heard it said...\"check your brain at the door\"...this is one of those movies that is brainless while pretending to be brainy (like the original). It fails miserably and their was really no need. The intriguing concept was already there. The template (or the Matrix) was created and the mythology was predetermined, so why turn it into a mindless exercise in excessive, paralyzing playtime.\n",
            "\n",
            "The battle scenes are OK the first ten times you view the invasion, but like the fisticuffs battle with Agent Smith at the end, just goes on for ever and ever draining all shock and awe from the events and leaves the viewer, in effect, feeling like they are watching someone else play a video game.\n",
            "\n",
            "Taken as an action film on its own it might pass as an eye candy (although quite depressing) look at another reality, but the coolness it invented is all but gone and the cyberpunk style has turned into Salvation Army chic.\n",
            "\n",
            "After all, it is a sad ending to a clever, groundbreaking beginning and we are left with borrowed mumbo jumbo philosophizing and a bleak, depressing, finale despite the pastel sunrise. \n",
            "\n",
            "98 ) This movie lives only for the success of the first part, which was pretty OK. But this movie is so ridiculous and superfluous, that I didn't want to see it again forever. I'm glad that at least Neo a.k.a. Keanu \"worst Actor ever\" Reeves died in the end of this horrible merchandising movie. At least I watched the whole movie only because of Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne, who did a great job! But the worst thing in this movie is the fact that there isn't any (senseful) dialog and it has only the focus on \"Action! Action! Action\".\n",
            "\n",
            "All in all a crappy and stupid imitativeness of the original.\n",

Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, a real edge of your seat type of deal. For one the natural disasters in the film can happen anytime, for example, the yellow stone caldera is a real super volcano that scientists and geologist have been studying. They do say it will erupt again in the future, but they don't know when? as for the earthquakes those are real, the shifting of continents? I guess a major event like that can happen?

John Cusack was good, but I feel they should have put a more action packed actor in it as the dad who saves his family, Cusack does not have action in him, but then again like I said he did a good job in the movie.\n",

The movie also makes me think about this, in times of disaster and dire need, how will we act towards other human beings? If we were on three boats, trying to survive, would we open the gates and let others in? Or leave them? Makes you think about your compassion and humanity.\n",

Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story. As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the \"Arks\" are chosen. What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction.

The special effects are also pretty great, it should be, that's what the whole movie is supposed to thrive off of. Now where this film does fall kinda short is the writing. To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical. So basically 2012 is a mediocre end of times disaster film with pretty good performances by good actors with less than average writing. 6/10 for 2012. \n",

But I didn't particularly like 2012. There's really only one reason I didn't like it but it's a big reason: the film gives you no reason for you to care more about the main characters than the billions of other people who die. Yes, tons of innocent people die in other disaster movies, like Independence Day and Dante's Peak (probably my favorite disaster movie), but the vast majority of the human race isn't killed in those. I didn't care about the family. I did care about Gordon (he was the one who flew them out of danger in the first place, after all) and he's crushed in the gears of the ark. In fact, quite a few of the people who are responsible, both directly and indirectly, for saving the family are killed, like Woody Harrelson's character, the Russian billionaire and pilot, and the astrophysicist.\n",

Don't get me wrong it was a great movie, a real edge of your seat type of deal. For one the natural disasters in the film can happen anytime, for example, the yellow stone caldera is a real super volcano that scientists and geologist have been studying.

The movie also makes me think about this, in times of disaster and dire need, how will we act towards other human beings?

Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story. As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the \"Arks\" are chosen.

To be completely honest, the dialogue between the characters isn't all that great, just not too creative. Great effects and even good actors unfortunately cannot make up for weak writing. The movie did have some promise, but unfortunately, it didn't live up nearly as much to what it could've been. There are some interesting scenes involving prophecy and the telling of the end times in the beginning of the movie. Although I did think that Harrelson's performance was a bit too crazy and overly comical.
